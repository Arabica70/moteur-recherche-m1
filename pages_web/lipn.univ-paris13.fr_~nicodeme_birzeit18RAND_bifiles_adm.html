In studying the problem of maximum nullity of matrices with a prescribed number of negative eigenvalues whose zero-nonzero pattern is determined by a given graph, the zero forcing game and its variants play crucial roles. In this talk, a modified version of the zero forcing game which plays an important role in studying the maximum nullity of acyclic and unicyclic matrices with one negative eigenvalue, a formula for the maximum nullity and exploration its behavior as a function of the number of negative eigenvalues, and a description of the matrices associated with trees that attain this maximum nullity will be presented. The analysis will then be extended to the unicyclic graphs. Joint work with Shaun Fallat, University of Regina, Canada.
