<hr> <li><b>Topological rigidity as a monoidal
equivalence</b>, <i>To be published, Communications in
Algebra, 2019,
30 pages</i>, <a href="Articles/Article_court_step_1.pdf">pdf</a>
</li>

<p>
A topological commutative ring is said to be rigid when for every set
$X$, the topological dual of the $X$-fold topological product of the
ring is isomorphic to the free module over $X$. Examples are fields
with a ring topology, discrete rings, and normed algebras. Rigidity
translates into a dual equivalence between categories of free modules
and of ``topologically-free'' modules and, with a suitable topological
tensor product for the latter, one proves that it lifts to an
equivalence between monoids in this category (some suitably generalized
topological algebras) and some coalgebras. In particular, we provide a
description of its relationship with the standard duality between
algebras and coalgebras, namely finite duality.

a (differential) Lie algebra into its Wronskian envelope</b>, <i>Communications

</li>

<p>Any commutative algebra equipped with a derivation may be
turned into a Lie algebra under the Wronskian bracket. This provides an
entirely new sort of a universal envelope for a Lie algebra, the
Wronskian envelope. The main result of this paper is the
characterization of those Lie algebras which embed into their Wronskian
envelope as Lie algebras of vector fields on a line. As a consequence
we show that, in contrast to the classical situation, free Lie algebras
almost never embed into their Wronskian envelope.</p>

Theory 6(1): 9-16, 2017</i>, <a href="Articles/Lipschitz-groups-Poinsot.pdf">pdf</a>, <a href="BibTex/Lipschitz.html">BibTeX</a>
</li>

<p> This contribution mainly focuses on some aspects of Lipschitz
groups, i.e., metrizable groups with Lipschitz multiplication and
inversion map. In the main result it is proved that metric groups, with
a translation-invariant metric, may be characterized as particular
group objects in the category of metric spaces and Lipschitz maps.
Moreover, up to an adjustment of the metric, any metrizable abelian
group also is shown to be a Lipschitz group. Finally we present a
result similar to the fact that any topological nilpotent element $x$
in a Banach algebra gives rise to an invertible element $1-x$, in the
setting of complete Lipschitz groups.</p>

<hr> <li><b>Differential (Lie) algebras from a
functorial point of view</b>, <i>Advances in Applied

</li>

<p>
It is well-known that any associative algebra becomes a Lie algebra
under the commutator bracket. This relation is actually functorial, and
this functor, as any algebraic functor, is known to admit a left
adjoint, namely the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. This
correspondence may be lifted to the setting of differential (Lie)
algebras. In this contribution it is shown that, also in the
differential context, there is another, similar, but somewhat
different, correspondence. Indeed any commutative differential algebra
becomes a Lie algebra under the Wronskian bracket
$W(a,b)=ab^{\prime}-a^{\prime}b$. It is proved that this correspondence
again is functorial, and that it admits a left adjoint, namely the
differential enveloping (commutative) algebra of a Lie algebra. Other
standard functorial constructions, such as the tensor and symmetric
algebras, are studied for algebras with a given derivation.

<hr> <li><b>The dual rings of an R-coring revisited</b>
  <b>(with
Hans-E. PORST)</b>, <i>Communications in Algebra 44:
944-964 (2016)</i>, <a href="Articles/The_dual_rings_of_an_R-coring_revisited.pdf">pdf</a>,
  <br>

  <a href="BibTex/Dual2016.html">BibTex</a>
</li>

<p>
It is shown that for every monoidal bi-closed category C left and right
dualization by means of the unit object not only defines a pair of
adjoint functors, but that these functors are monoidal as functors from
C^{op}, the dual monoidal category of C into the transposed monoidal
category C^t. We, thus, generalize the case of a symmetric monoidal
category, where this kind of dualization is a special instance of
convolution. We apply this construction to the monoidal category of
bimodules over a not necessarily commutative ring R and so obtain
various contravariant dual ring functors defined on the category of
R-corings. It becomes evident that previous, hitherto apparently
unrelated constructions of this kind are all special instances of our
construction and, hence, coincide. Finally we show that Sweedler's Dual
Coring Theorem is a simple consequence of our approach and that these
dual ring constructions are compatible with the processes of (co)freely
adjoining (co)units. </p>

<hr> <li><b>Rigidity of the topological dual spaces
of formal power series with respect to product topologies</b>, <i>Topology
and its Applications 189: 147-175, 2015</i>, <a href="Articles/Rigidity.pdf">pdf</a>, <a href="BibTex/Rigidity.html">BibTeX</a>
</li>

<p>
Even in spaces of formal power series is required a topology in order
to legitimate some operations, in particular to compute infinite
summations. In general the topologies considered are just a product of
the topology of the base field, an inverse limit topology or a topology
induced by a pseudo-valuation. As our main result we prove the
following phenomenon: the (left and right) topological dual spaces of
formal power series equipped with the product topology with respect to
any Hausdorff division ring topology on the base division ring, are all
the same, namely just the space of polynomials. As a consequence, this
kind of rigidity forces linear maps, continuous with respect to any
(and then to all) those topologies, to be defined by very particular
infinite matrices similar to row-finite matrices. </p>

<hr> <li><b>Free monoids over semigroups in a
monoidal category: construction and applications</b> <b>(with
Hans-E. PORST)</b>, <i>Communications in Algebra 43:
4873-4899, 2015</i>, <a href="Articles/AdjoiningUnit.pdf">pdf</a>,
  <a href="BibTex/AdjoiningUnit.html">BibTeX</a>
</li>

<p>
The adjunction of a unit to an algebraic structure with a given binary
associative operation is discussed by interpreting such structures as
semigroups and monoids respectively in a monoidal category. This
approach then allows for results on the adjunction of counits to
coalgebraic structures with a binary co-associative co-operation as
well. Special attention is paid to situations where a given coalgebraic
structure induces a ``dual" algebraic one; here the compatibility of
adjoining (co)units and dualization is examined. The extension of this
process to starred algebraic structures and to monoid actions is
discussed as well. Particular emphasis is given to examples from many
areas of mathematics.

It is well-known that degree two finite field extensions can be
equipped with a Hermitian-like structure similar to the extension of
the complex field over the reals. In this contribution, using this
structure, we develop a modular character theory and the appropriate
Fourier transform for some particular kind of finite Abelian groups.
Moreover we introduce the notion of bent functions for finite field
valued functions rather than usual complex-valued functions, and we
study several of their properties.

<p>
On any set $X$ may be defined the free algebra $R\langle X\rangle$
(respectively, free commutative algebra $R[X]$) with coefficients in a
ring $R$. It may also be equivalently described as the algebra of the
free monoid $X^*$ (respectively, free commutative monoid
$\mathpzc{M}(X)$). Furthermore, the algebra of differential polynomials
$R\{X\}$ with variables in $X$ may be constructed. The main objective
of this contribution is to provide a functorial description of this
kind of objects with their relations (including abelianization and
unitarization) in the category of differential algebras, and also to
introduce new structures such as the differential algebra of a
semigroup, of a monoid, or the universal differential envelope of an
algebra.

</li>

<p>
The set of natural integers is fundamental for at least two reasons: it
is the free induction algebra over the empty set (and at such allows
definitions of maps by primitive recursion) and it is the free monoid
over a one-element set, the latter structure being a consequence of the
former. In this contribution, we study the corresponding structure in
the linear setting, i.e. in the category of modules over a
commutative ring rather than in the category of sets, namely the free
module generated by the integers. It also provides free structures of
induction algebra and of monoid (in the category of modules). Moreover
we prove that each of its linear endomorphisms admits a unique normal
form, explicitly constructed, as a non-commutative formal power series.

<p>
A locally finite category is defined as a category in which every arrow
as only finitely many different ways to be factorized by composable
arrows. The large algebra of such categories over some field may be
defined, and with it a group of invertible series (under
multiplication). For certain particular locally finite categories, a
substitution operation, generalizing the usual substitution of formal
power series, may be defined, and with it a group of reversible series
(invertible under substitution). Moreover both groups are actually
pro-affine algebraic groups. In this contribution we study the Hopf
algebras of coordinate functions on these groups and show that the
semi-direct product structure obtained from the action of reversible
series on invertible series by (anti-)automorphisms gives rise to an
interaction at the level of their Hopf algebras of coordinate functions
under the form of a smash coproduct.

<p>
An operator on formal power series of the form $S\mapsto \mu
S(\sigma)$, where $\mu$ is an invertible power series, and $\sigma$ is
a series of the form $\t+\mathcal{O}(\t^2)$ is called a unipotent
substitution with pre-function. Such operators, denoted by a pair
$(\mu,\sigma)$, form a group. The objective of this contribution is to
show that it is possible to define a generalized powers for such
operators, as for instance fractional powers
$(\mu,\sigma)^{\frac{a}{b}}$ for every $\frac{a}{b}\in\mathbb{Q}$. </p>

<p>
The famous Poincar&eacute;-Birkhoff-Witt theorem states that a Lie
algebra, free as a module, embeds into its associative envelope - its
universal enveloping algebra - as a sub-Lie algebra for the usual
commutator Lie bracket. However there is another functorial way - less
known - to associate a Lie algebra to an associative algebra, and
inversely. Any commutative algebra equipped with a derivation $a\mapsto
a^{\prime}$, i.e., a commutative differential algebra, admits a
Wronskian bracket $W(a,b)=ab^{\prime}-a^{\prime}b$ under which it
becomes a Lie algebra. Conversely, to any Lie algebra is universally
associated a commutative differential algebra, its Wronskian envelope,
in a way similar to the associative envelope. This contribution is the
beginning of an investigation of these relations between Lie algebras
and differential algebras which is parallel to the classical theory. In
particular, we give a sufficient condition under which a Lie algebra
may be embedded into its Wronskian envelope, and we present the
construction of the free Lie algebra with this property.

<hr> <li><b>The Tutte-Grothendieck group of an
alphabetic rewriting system</b>, <i>ISRN Combinatorics
2013, Article ID 574578, 11 pages (2013),</i> <a href="Articles/Poinsot_ISRN.pdf">pdf</a>, <a href="BibTex/Tutte-Grothendieck.html">BibTeX</a>
</li>

<p>The two operations, deletion and contraction of an edge, on
multigraphs directly lead to the Tutte polynomial which satisfies a
universal problem. As observed by Brylawski in terms of order
relations, these operations may be interpreted as a particular instance
of a general theory which involves universal invariants like the Tutte
polynomial, and a universal group, called the Tutte-Grothendieck group.
In this contribution, Brylawski's theory is extended in two ways: first
of all, the order relation is replaced by a string rewriting system,
and secondly, commutativity by partial commutations (that permits a
kind of interpolation between non commutativity and full
commutativity). This allows us to clarify the relations between the
semigroup subject to rewriting and the Tutte-Grothendieck group: the
later is actually the Grothendieck group completion of the former, up
to the free adjunction of a unit (this was even not mention by
Brylawski), and normal forms may be seen as universal invariants.
Moreover we prove that such universal constructions are also possible
in case of a non convergent rewriting system, outside the scope of
Brylawski's work.</p>

<p>Perfect nonlinear functions from a finite group $G$ to another
one $H$ are those functions $f: G \rightarrow H$ such that for all
nonzero $\alpha \in G$, the derivative $d_{\alpha}f: x \mapsto f(\alpha
x) f(x)^{-1}$ is balanced. In the case where both $G$ and $H$ are
Abelian groups, $f: G \rightarrow H$ is perfect nonlinear if and only
if $f$ is bent i.e for all nonprincipal character $\chi$ of $H$, the
(discrete) Fourier transform of $\chi \circ f$ has a constant magnitude
equals to $|G|$. In this paper, using the theory of linear
representations, we exhibit similar bentness-like characterizations in
the cases where $G$ and/or $H$ are (finite) non Abelian groups. Thus we
extend the concept of bent functions to the framework of non Abelian
groups.</p>

</li>

<p>Starting with the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, fundamental to
quantum physics, we first show how the ordering of the non-commuting
operators intrinsic to that algebra gives rise to generalizations of
the classical Stirling Numbers of Combinatorics. These may be expressed
in terms of infinite, but row-finite, matrices, which may also be
considered as endomorphisms of $\mathbb{C}[[x]]$. This leads us to
consider endomorphisms in more general spaces, and these in turn may be
expressed in terms of generalizations of the ladder-operators familiar
in physics.</p>

  <a href="BibTex/mobius.html">BibTeX</a>
</li>

<p>The M&ouml;bius inversion formula, introduced during the
19th century in number theory, was generalized to a wide class of
monoids called locally finite such as the free partially commutative,
plactic and hypoplactic monoids for instance. In this contribution are
developed and used some topological and algebraic notions for monoids
with zero, similar to ordinary objects such as the (total) algebra of a
monoid, the augmentation ideal or the star operation on proper series.
The main concern is to extend the study of the M&ouml;bius function
to some monoids with zero, i.e., with an absorbing element, in
particular the so-called Rees quotients of locally finite monoids. Some
relations between the M&ouml;bius functions of a monoid and its
Rees quotient are also provided.</p>

</li>

<p>The concern of this paper is a famous combinatorial formula
known under the name "exponential formula". It occurs quite naturally
in many contexts (physics, mathematics, computer science). Roughly
speaking, it expresses that the exponential generating function of a
whole structure is equal to the exponential of those of connected
substructures. Keeping this descriptive statement as a guideline, we
develop a general framework to handle many different situations in
which the exponential formula can be applied.</p>

  <a href="Articles/ParMon.pdf">pdf</a>, <a href="BibTex/partialmonoids.html">BibTeX</a>
</li>

<p>A partial monoid $P$ is a set with a partial multiplication
$\times$ (and total identity $1_P$) which satisfies some associativity
axiom. The partial monoid $P$ may be embedded in a free monoid $P^*$
and the product $\star$ is simulated by a string rewriting system on
$P^*$ that consists in evaluating the concatenation of two letters as a
product in $P$, when it is defined, and a letter $1_P$ as the empty
word $\epsilon$. In this paper we study the profound relations between
confluence for such a system and associativity of the multiplication.
Moreover we develop a reduction strategy to ensure confluence and which
allows us to define a multiplication on normal forms associative up to
a given congruence of $P^*$. Finally we show that this operation is
associative if, and only if, the rewriting system under consideration
is confluent.</p>

<p>The Riordan group is the semi-direct product of a
multiplicative group of invertible series and a group, under
substitution, of non units. The Riordan near algebra, as introduced in
this paper, is the Cartesian product of the algebra of formal power
series and its principal ideal of non units, equipped with a product
that extends the multiplication of the Riordan group. The later is
naturally embedded as a subgroup of units into the former. In this
paper, we prove the existence of a formal calculus on the Riordan
algebra. This formal calculus plays a role similar to those of
holomorphic calculi in the Banach or Fr&eacute;chet algebras
setting, but without the constraint of a radius of convergence. Using
this calculus, we define "en passant" a notion of generalized powers in
the Riordan group.</p>

<p>Due to implementation constraints the XOR operation is widely
used in order to combine plaintext and key bit-strings in secret-key
block ciphers. This choice directly induces the classical version of
the differential attack by the use of XOR-kind differences. While very
natural, there are many alternatives to the XOR. Each of them inducing
a new form for its corresponding differential attack (using the
appropriate notion of difference) and therefore block-ciphers need to
use S-boxes that are resistant against these nonstandard differential
cryptanalysis. In this contribution we study the functions that offer
the best resistance against a differential attack based on a finite
field multiplication. We also show that in some particular cases, there
are robust permutations which offers the best resistant against both
multiplication and exponentiation base differential attacks. We call
them doubly perfect nonlinear permutations.</p>

<p>The left-regular multiplication is explicitly embedded in the
notion of perfect nonlinearity. But there exist many other group
actions. By replacing translations by another group action the new
concept of group action-based perfect nonlinearity has been introduced.
In this paper we show that this generalized concept of nonlinearity is
actually equivalent to a new bentness notion that deals with functions
defined on a finite Abelian group G that acts on a finite set X and
with values in the finite-dimensional vector space of complex-valued
functions defined on X.</p>

</li>

<p>A function from a finite Abelian group $G$ and with values in
the unit circle $T$ of the complex field is called bent if its Fourier
transform (i.e., the decomposition of $f$ in the basis of characters of
$G$) has a constant magnitude equal to the number of elements of $G$.
In this contribution we define a modulo 2 notion of characters by
allowing the characters of an elementary finite Abelian p-group $G$ to
take their values in the multiplicative group $GF(2^n)^*$ (with $p =
2^n &minus; 1$) of the roots of the unity in the finite field
$GF(2^n$ ) with $2^n$ elements rather than in the complex roots of the
unity $T$. We show that this kind of characters forms an orthogonal
basis of the $GF(2^n )$-vector space of functions from $G$ to $GF(2^n)$
that permits us to define a modulo 2 version of the Fourier transform
(as a decomposition of a vector in this basis of characters). We show
that many classical properties of the Fourier transform still hold for
this characteristic 2 version. In particular, we can define an
appropriate notion of bent functions, called $GF(2^n)$-bent functions,
with respect to this Fourier transform. Finally we construct a class of
$GF(2^n)$-bent functions and we also study their relations with
classical and group action versions of perfect nonlinearity.</p>

<p>Perfect nonlinear functions are used to construct DES-like
cryptosystems that are resistant to differential attacks.We present
generalized DES-like cryptosystems where the XOR operation is replaced
by a general group action. The new cryptosystems, when combined with
G-perfect nonlinear functions (similar to classical perfect nonlinear
functions with one XOR replaced by a general group action), allow us to
construct systems resistant to modified differential attacks. The more
general setting enables robust cryptosystems with parameters that would
not be possible in the classical setting. We construct several examples
of G-perfect nonlinear functions, both $\Z_2$-valued and
$\Z_2^a$-valued. Our final constructions demonstrate G-perfect
nonlinear planar permutations (from $\Z_2^a$ to itself), thus providing
an alternative implementation to current uses of almost perfect
nonlinear functions.</p>

<p>The objective of this contribution is to introduce an analogue
to the classical secretkey block ciphers, such as DES, IDEA or AES, in
the nondenumerable setting, namely where cleartexts, plaintexts and
keys are real numbers. The nonlinear part of traditional secretkey
block ciphers, the S-boxes, is designed to provide confusion, i.e., to
resist to several kind of cryptanalysis such as algebraic, differential
or linear attacks. By analogy we construct S-boxes in the uncountable
setting which provide the best resistance to a classical or modified
version of the differential attack. Since our S-boxes are real-valued
functions defined on the real-line, we also need to prevent possible
new attacks based on real analysis (such as continuity and
derivability), which are ignored since impossible in the finite case:
we must hide the topological structure. So we introduce a new kind of
discontinuous boxes for this purpose.</p>

<p>Bent or perfect nonlinear Boolean functions represent the best
resistance against the so-called linear and differential cryptanalysis.
But this kind of cryptographic relevant functions only exists when the
number of input bits m is an even integer and is larger than the double
of the number of output bits n. Unfortunately the non-existence cases,
the odd dimension (m is an odd integer) or the plane dimension ( m = n
), are not illegitimate from a cryptographic point of view and even
commonly considered. New notions of bentness and perfect nonlinearity
are then needed in those impossible cases for the traditional theory.
In this paper, by replacing the usual XOR by another kind of
bit-strings combination, we explicitly construct new
&ldquo;bent&rdquo; Boolean functions in traditionally
impossible cases. </p>

<p>We introduce the notion of a bent function on a finite
nonabelian group which is a natural generalization of the well-known
notion of bentness on a finite abelian group due to Logachev, Salnikov
and Yashchenko. Using the theory of linear representations and
noncommutative harmonic analysis of finite groups we obtain several
properties of such functions similar to the corresponding properties of
traditional Abelian bent functions.</p>

<p>The concept of bent functions, originally introduced by Dillon
and Rothaus, is very relevant in cryptography because this kind of
functions represents the maximal resistance against the so-called
linear cryptanalysis. In 1997, Logachev, Salnikov and Yashchenko
described a fundamental notion of bentness for functions defined on a
finite Abelian group G with values in the unit circle of the complex
field. in this paper, by replacing this unit circle by the unit
hypersphere S_H(0_H,1) of an arbitrary finite-dimensional Hermitian
space H, we develop a generalization of the concept of bentness for
S_H(0_H,1)-valued functions defined on G, called multidimensional bent
functions.</p>

<p>In a recent paper, we generalized the notion of perfect
nonlinearity of boolean functions by replacing the translations of a
vector space on $\mathbb{F}_2$ by an Abelian group of fixed-point free
involutions acting regularly on this vector space. We now show this
generalization to be still valid when considering a finite nonempty set
$X$ rather than a vector space on $\mathbb{F}_2$ and a faithful or
regular action of a finite Abelian group $G$ on $X$. We also develop a
dual characterization of this new concept through the Fourier transform
as for the classical notion of perfect nonlinearity. By considering
faithful actions we highlight a fundamental concept underlying to
perfect nonlinearity that extends the classical notions. In short we
integrate the traditional concepts within a more general and primitive
framework.</p>

<p>The notions of perfect nonlinearity and bent functions are
closely dependent on the action of the group of translations over
$\mathbb{F}_2^m$. Extending the idea to more generalized groups of
involutions without fixed points gives a larger framework to the
previous notions. In this paper we largely develop this concept to
define $G$-perfect nonlinearity and $G$-bent functions, where $G$ is an
Abelian group of involutions, and to show their equivalence as in the
classical case.</p>
