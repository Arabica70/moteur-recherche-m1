<font color=red>"an introduction to dynamical systems : basic definitions and examples"</font>
</li>
<li>
A dynamical system is an action of a map on a space. An orbit is the set of iterates of this map on a point of the space. The main question one can ask about a dynamical system is : how do the orbits behave ? 
The aim of this short course will be to explain how a purely
deterministic dynamical system may give rise to random behaviors. Basic
notions of topological and measurable dynamics will be introduced and
illustrated on examples : dynamics on the interval, on the circle, on
the shift space.
