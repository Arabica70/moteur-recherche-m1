          <p>This initiative is intended to foster a science and technology
            program lead and hosted by higher education institutions in France
            and their industrial partners. The program will showcase to US
            students from the University of Maryland, some world-renowned French
            industrial sites and research centers working on cyber-security as
            well as practical aspects of security. The program will also nurture
            networking between US students and French ones. Both populations
            will benefit from exchanges on campus life (including student and
            alumni associations), entrepreneurship, internship search and
            job-hunting.</p>
          <p>The first week of the programme&nbsp; is organized by the
            Université de Paris 13, <a href="http://www.univ-paris13.fr/acces-aux-campus.html">Campus

          <h3>Elevator pitch</h3>
          <p>This opportunity should be considered as the beginning of the
            dialogue between the host institutions and the University of
            Maryland. The level of the classes will be adapted on a
            topic-by-topic basis to the level of students; it may go from
            introductory to PhD and advanced research level. In French, we would
            say that the program is going to be “A LA CARTE !”</p>
          <p>France has a long history of dealing with security on civilian and
            military questions. The French approach is slightly different from
            the American one. Some knowledge on these differences will be
            beneficial to anybody aiming for a career with an international
            component.</p>

The Maryland University students will be accompanied throughout the day by Networks Security and Computer Science students from IUT de Villetaneuse, Université Paris 13.<br><br>

The IUT students will act as translators / facilitators as needs be, guiding the Maryland students through the various planned activities (presentations, conferences, lunch).<br><br>

The day will end with a personal tour of the campus conducted by the IUT students.<br><br>

This visit will provide a framework for the exchange of information around students' respective studies, in-company expreriences, and general lives.<br><br>

Paris 13 students' participation in this day is an integral part of their English projects and will be assessed as such through a written report and an oral presentation at a later date.

Title: DoS in wireless network and cloud  an Issue or Fatality? 
<br><br> Wireless and mobile networks have many advantages as easy
deployment, user mobility and provides network access to users
regardless to their locations. The most critical problems that arise
in these networks are on the resource allocations as the bandwidth is
limited, the propagation (multi-path, fading, distortion) and security
since communications are transmitted over radio waves. I parallel new
architectures/technologies have been emerged as cloud computing.  In
this talk I will present issues about availability problem in those
networks and architecture, and I will present some works we have done
to improve security in those systems.
