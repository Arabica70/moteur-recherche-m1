 <B>Warning</B>: We have often been asked what is our job, what
	 work are doing as research work?
 Despite all of our efforts to remain vague and incomprehensible, our parents, our friends invariably responded to our explanations: "yes, yes..."; while sighing more or less, more intrigued than ever. Therefore we resigned
	 ourselves to
 tell the astonished world, not our work, but what is the life of a
 PhD student. It would seem that we suceeded, if we trust the first
 reactions.</P>

<B>Note</b>: This parody is based on 
"Le petit Nicolas" ("Little Nicholas"), a character created by Sempé (a
french humorous drawer) and Goscinny (the famous scenarist of the comics
"Astérix"). They wrote together short and very funny novels, relating
adventures of their character
(<A HREF="http://www.petitnicolas.com/">official website</a>, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_petit_Nicolas">wikipedia article</a>).
<BR>
If you appreciate it, I suggest you buy the original very funny stories: great &amp; cheap &amp; "chouette=neaaaat" books! A wonderful compilation of until now
unpublished stories (650 pages!) appeared in 2005, followed by a volume 2 (384 pages) in 2006.
