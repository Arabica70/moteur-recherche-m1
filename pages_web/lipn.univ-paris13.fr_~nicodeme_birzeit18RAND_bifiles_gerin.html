<font color=red>"Uniform random permutations"</font>
</li>
<li>
This course is at the crossroads of combinatorics and probability. I
will present different aspects of uniform random permutations: How to
simulate them? How to sort them? What can be said about the typical
number of cycles? the typical number of fixed points?
We will see in passing several universal phenomena in probability: the
Poisson paradigm, reinforcement, size-bias.
