Cancelling or reversing the effect of a former action is a necessity
in most interactive systems. The simplest and most frequent form of
this facility is the "undo" command that is available in usual,
individual, text or graphic editors. As soon as collaborative work is
considered, undoing is more intricate since the notion of a last
action is not always meaningful. Within this framework, the so-called
"selective undo", which allows selecting and cancelling any (or rather
some?) former action, has received lot of attention. There are some
similarities between cooperative work and composite web services:
Component web services are concurrently accessed; they may be treated
as shared documents for undoing former actions. Among the latest
results on undoing in group editors, the transformational model seems
suitable for generalization to other kinds of distributed systems. It
completely avoids backward state recovery and allows the selection and
cancellation of any former operation. We present some relevant aspects
of this model, and then some hints on how to transpose it into the
framework of composite web services.

Externalized and Internalized Notions of Behavioral Refinement
<BR>(joint work with M. Bidoit)
<BR><BR>
Many different behavioral refinement notions for algebraic specifications have
been proposed in the literature but the relationship between the various
concepts is still unclear. In this paper we provide a classification and a
comparative study of behavioral refinements according to two directions, the
externalized approach which uses an explicit behavioral abstraction
operator that is applied to the specification to be implemented, and the
internalized approach which uses a built-in behavioral semantics of
specifications. We show that both concepts are equivalent under suitable
conditions. The formal basis of our study is provided by the COL institution
(constructor-based observational logic). Hence, as a side-effect of our study
on internalized behavioral refinements, we introduce also a novel concept of
behavioral refinement for COL-specifications.

RIES - Internet Voting in Action
(<A HREF="http://www.cs.ru.nl/B.Jacobs/PAPERS/compsac2005.pdf">paper</A>)
<BR><BR>
RIES stands for Rijnland Internet Election System.
It is an online voting system that was developed by one of the 
Dutch local authorities on water management. The system has been 
used twice in the fall of 2004 for in total approximately two 
million potential voters. We describe how this system 
works. Furthermore we do not only describe how the outcome of the 
elections can be verified but also how it has been verified by us.
To conclude we describe some possible points for improvement.

<LI><a name="Kurz">Alexander Kurz:</a> Operations and Equation for Coalgebras
<BR>
(joint work with J. Rosicky, appeared in Mathematical Structures in
Computer Science 15:149-166, 2005)
<BR><BR>
1.) Usually, coalgebras are given wrt a functor. We show that coalgebras
can also be given by operations and equations. This relies on work of
Linton from 1969 who showed how to specify algebras over an abribrary
base category and, for example, proved that a  category is monadic (over
some base category) if and only if it has a presentation by operations
and equations and has free algebras (thus generalising a theorem
well-known for algebras over Set). Since coalgebras over Set are (dual
to) algebras over Set^op, Lintons approach gives a notion of operations
and equations for coalgebras. We give some examples.
<BR>
<BR>
2.) Given an arbitrary functor U:A-->Set, we say that two elements a,a'
of two objects in A are *bisimilar* if they can be connected by
morphisms in A. We show that coalgebraic operations correspond to
predicate transformers that respect bisimulation and that coalgebraic
equations correspond to modal predicates.
<BR>
<BR>
3.) Given a functor U:A-->Set, an (n,m)-ary *implicit* (coalgebraic)
operation is a natural transformation Set(U-,n)-->Set(U-,m). We show
that classes of coalgebras closed under subcoalgebras, homomorphic
images and coproducts are precisely the classes definable by equations
in implicit operations. This theorem does not require the existence of
cofree coalgebras and therefore generalises previously known
Birkhoff-style theorems for coalgebras. It is the analogue for
coalgebras of Reiterman's famous theorem in universal algebra.

<a name="MartiOliet">Narciso Marti-Oliet:</a> Towards a strategy language for Maude
<BR>(joint work with Jose Meseguer and Alberto Verdejo)
<BR><BR>
We describe a proposal for a strategy language for Maude, to
control the rewriting process and to be used at the object level instead of
at the metalevel. We also describe a prototype implementation built over
Full Maude using the metalevel and the metalanguage facilities provided
by Maude. We include a series of examples that illustrate the main
features of the proposed strategy language. This language
has been put to work in the implementation of operational semantics
for the ambient calculus and for the parallel functional language Eden.

Reactive Systems for Context Borrowing, Symbolic Execution and Web Service 
Binding
<BR><BR>
by Ugo Montanari, Dipartimento di Informatica, Università di Pisa
<BR><BR>
Joint work with Roberto Bruni, Gianluigi Ferrari, Fabio Gadducci,
Pawel Sobocinski and Emilio Tuosto
<BR><BR>

A systematic method for deriving bisimulation congruence from
reduction rules has been proposed by Leifer and Milner, on turn
inspired by Sewell. Also,the approach of observing contexts imposed on
agents at each step has been proposed earlier by Montanari and
Sassone, yielding the notion of dynamic bisimilarity. The basic idea
of Leifer and Milner is to express "minimality"conditions for electing
the context c among the (possibly infinite) ones that allow p to
react. These conditions have been distilled by them in the notion of
relative push-out (RPO) in a categories of reactive systems and made
more general by Sassone, Sobocinski and Lack. The RPO construction is
reminiscent of the unification process of logic programming, which in
fact can be given an interactive semantics in much the same style. In
the talk we present a short survey of the work by Leifer and Milner
and Sassone, Sobocinski and Lack, and describe some recent
developments which allow to see this approach under a larger
viewpoint. The first contribution [1] observes contexts also for
symbolic execution, suggesting applications to web service binding;
the second [2] tackles the weak case by taking advantage of the tile
model; and the third [3] uses cospan categories on adhesive
categories, as suggested by Sassone, Sobocinski and Lack, for
representing process calculi as graph transformation systems.

Heterogeneous Framework Integration Initiative
(<A HREF="http://www.tzi.de/~till/papers/ifip-calco.pdf">slides</A>)

<BR><BR>
The Heterogeneous Framework Integration Initiative has been initiated
during January 2005 meeting of the IFIP WG 1.3. It aims at foundations
and tools supporting the use of several modelling techniques during
the development of systems, including
logics, semi-formal notations such as the UML, and parallel program design
languages and calculi, inter alia.  This effort responds to the
challenge that software and hardware
companies are facing to use multiple viewpoints when specifying
complex software intensive systems: various viewpoint
specifications are often needed to capture various specific aspect of the
system, with global properties of system behaviour emerging from their
composition.
Moreover, heterogenetiy may also arise in the course of software
development: changes in the formalisms involved may be needed, as
appropriate for the given stage.
<BR><BR>
In spite of a number of proposals for ad-hoc combinations of
different formalisms, we are not yet at a stage where modelling
techniques can be integrated in a systematic way.  Moreover, we
need to provide levels of semantic-based integration that can
extend to tools and provide environments in which the design of
software and hardware systems is an activity that meets engineering
standards of quality and trust.  Finally, we need such environments to
be endowed with an architecture that facilitates run-time integration
and interoperability in order to avoid the risk of combinatorial
explosion incurred when integration is performed at "compile-time".

Dialgebraic specification and modeling
(<A HREF="http://ls5-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/~peter/SwanSlides.pdf">slides</A>)
<BR><BR>
Dialgebraic specifications combine algebraic with coalgebraic ones. We
present a uniform syntax, semantics and proof system for chains of
signatures and axioms such that presentations of visible data types
may alternate with those of hidden state types. Each element in the
chain matches a design pattern that reflects some least/initial or
greatest/final model construction over the respective predecessor in
the chain. We sort out twelve such design patterns. Six of them lead
to least models, the other six to greatest models. Each construction
of the first group has its dual in the second group. All categories
used in this approach are classes of structures with many-sorted
carrier sets. The model constructions could be generalized to other
categories, but this is not a goal of our approach. On the contrary,
we aim at applications in software (and, maybe, also hardware) design
and will show that for describing and solving problems in this area
one need not go beyond categories of sets. Consequently, a fairly
simple, though sufficiently powerful, syntax of dialgebraic
specifications that builds upon classical algebraic notations as much
as possible is crucial here. It captures the main constructions of
both universal (co)algebra and relational fixpoint semantics, and
thereby extends "Lawvere-style" algebraic theories from product to
arbitrary polynomial types and modal logics from one- to many-sorted
Kripke frames.

Domain Theoretic Analysis of Separated Hybrid Automata
(<A HREF="http://www.pst.ifi.lmu.de/~pattinso/Talks/">slides</A>)
<BR><BR>
We define a domain theoretic semantics of non-linear
hybrid automata, and shows that this denotational semantics is effectively
computable. For a hybrid automaton H, the semantics assigns to
every point t in time the set $[| H |](t) of states that H can enter into
at time t, starting from one if its initial states. The semantic function is
defined as a least fixpoint in the domain of compact-set valued
functions of one real variable. This allows to use standard
domain theoretic techniques to obtain effective algorithms to
compute the semantic function, resulting in a directly implementable
framework for the reachability analysis of a large class of
non-linear hybrid automata. As a by-product, we obtain several new
computability and continuity results for hybrid automata.

On testing and specifying

<BR>
talk by Dusko Pavlovic (joint work in progress with Bart Jacobs)
<BR><BR>
In the various areas of computer science, the notions of testing are
formulated in different ways, and studied with different goals: e.g.,
in concurrency theory, tests are used to establish equivalence of
processes, whereas in software engineering, they are used to show that
the implementations do not satisfy specifications. We present some
preliminary results of work towards a general testing framework,
allowing both qualitative and quantitative comparison of processes, on
different levels of abstraction. Of particular interest are
applications in representing distributed probabilistic processes, such
as cryptosystems, and quantifying the information flows between them.

Modelling and verification with synchronous protocol automata
<BR>
S. Ramesh, GM R&D Bangalore and IIT Bombay
<BR><BR>
Plug-n-Play style Intellectual Property(IP) reuse in System
on Chip(SoC) design is facilitated by the use of an on-chip bus architecture.
Component integration and verification in such systems is a cumbersome
and time consuming process largely concerned with interfacing
related issues. We present a synchronous, Finite State Machine based
framework for modelling communication aspects of such architectures.
This formalism has been developed via interaction with designers and
the industry and is intuitive and light weight. We have developed cycle
accurate methods which can be used for protocol specification, compatibility
verification, interface synthesis and model checking with automated
specification. The case studies we performed include the AMBA family of
protocols and a proprietary industrial bus protocol. Our experience has
shown that our models enable reasoning about and comparison of di
                                                                 erent
bus architectures to gain valuable design insights. We demonstrate
the utility of our framework by modelling the AMBA bus architecture
including details such as pipelined operation, burst transfers, the AHBAPB
bridge and arbitration features.

Algebraic specification and coalgebraic synthesis of

<BR><BR>
We introduce the notion of functional stream derivative, generalising
the notion of input derivative of rational expressions (Brzozowski
1964) to the case of stream functions over arbitrary input and output
alphabets. We show how to construct Mealy automata from algebraically
specified stream functions by the symbolic computation of functional
stream derivatives.  We illustrate this construction in full detail
for various bitstream functions specified in the algebraic calculus of
the 2-adic numbers.  This work is part of a larger ongoing effort to
specify and model component connector circuits in terms of (functions
and relations on) streams.

<BR><BR>
Abstract. We present a model-checking algorithm which can be used to
evaluate access control policies, and a tool which implements it. The
evaluation includes not only assessing whether the policies give
legitimate users enough permissions to reach their goals, but also
checking whether the policies prevent intruders from reaching their
malicious goals. Policies of the access control system and goals of
agents must be described in the access control description and
specification language introduced as RW in our earlier work. The
algorithm takes a policy description and a goal as input and performs
two modes of checking. In the assessing mode, the algorithm searches
for strategies consisting of reading and writing steps which allow the
agents to achieve their goals no matter what states the system may be
driven into during the execution of the strategies. In the intrusion
detection mode, a weaker notion of strategy is used, reflecting the
willingness of intruders to guess the value of attributes which they
cannot read.

Finite models for coalgebraic logic 
(<A HREF="http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~lschrode/talks/cml-slides.pdf">slides</A>)
<BR><BR>
In recent years, a tight connection has emerged between modal logic on
the one hand and coalgebras, understood as generic transition systems,
on the other hand. Here, we prove that finitary coalgebraic modal logic
has the finite model property. This fact not only reproves known
completeness results for coalgebraic modal logic, which we push further
by establishing that every coalgebraic modal logic admits a complete
rank-$1$-axiomatization; it also enables us to establish a generic
decidability result and a first complexity bound. Examples covered by
these general results include, besides standard Hennessy-Milner logic,
graded modal logic and probabilistic modal logic.

Specification and Computation with Continuous Data
<BR><BR>
J V Tucker (Swansea)
<BR><BR>
This talk reports on my work with J I Zucker (McMaster).
<BR><BR>
We consider computability theory for infinite data, such as real
numbers, signals and wave forms, streams, spatial objects, and
functions. Usually, such data is collected into topological spaces and
so we consider models of computation for functions and sets on
topological spaces.
<BR><BR>
The many models fall into two types. First, there are concrete models
of computation which depend on building a representation of the space
of data, usually from the natural numbers, and defining computability
on the space in terms of computability on the representation. This is
the standard approach of Computable Analysis starting in the 1950s; it
is used in current work based on Pour El and Richards' computation
structures, Klaus Weihrauch's TTE, Stoltenberg-Hansen, Tucker and
Edalat's domain representations, and Spreen's effective topology.
<BR><BR>
Secondly, there are abstract models that define computability
independently of all representations. The spaces are given algebraic
structure (e.g., that of a Banach space) and programs and machines are
based on the structure. Thus, computation is abstract in precisely the
way algebra is abstract: computation is invariant under
isomorphism. This is the approach of many generalisations of recursion
theory starting in the 1950s; it is used in some current work by S
Smale and his collaborators (on rings and fields) and J I Zucker and J
V Tucker (on many sorted algebras).
<BR><BR>
The lecture discussed some current results and problems, especially on
the equivalence of the concrete and abstract models. Recent results of
Tucker and Zucker show that equivalence is possible for very general
topological data types but requires a study of programmable
approximations of partial multivalued functions on metric algebras.
<BR><BR>
We also discussed applications to the theory of algebraic
specification of exact computation on real numbers and metric data
types in general. We showed that there exist finite algebraic
specifications, called universal specifications, that can define all
the computably approximable functions on a metric algebra. Thus, there
exist finite sets of algebraic formulae that can define uniquely all
the computable systems and processes that can be faithfully simulated
on a computer.
