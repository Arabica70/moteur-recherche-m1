<BR>Biological Regulatory Networks modeled as an institution: 
property preservation along embedding
<BR>[Joint work with Mbarka MABROUKI and Marc AIGUIER]
<BR>Abstract:<BR> 
In the course of understanding the functioning of cellular processes,
or more specifically of biological regulatory networks, scientists
usually focused on subparts of the global system. Then modeling
frameworks for biological regulatory networks are mandatory in order
to reason on the models and their properties. Various model-checking
technics have already been successfully used to reason on discrete
models of biological regulatory networks where studied biological
properties are expressed by temporal formulas. In this talk, we take
benefit of these logical approaches to study the properties
preservation. Signature of considered networks, constituted by a
graph, is one of the distinctive features on which embeddings can be
defined, leading us to give a first condition on the subgraphs which
allows us to preserve properties of the embedded graphs. We thus give
a first proposition for defining biological regulatory networks as an 
institution.

<BR> A logic of graph constraints.
<BR>[Joint work with Hartmut Ehrig and Ulrike Prange, 
Tech. Univ. Berlin, Germany]
<BR>Abstract:<BR>  
Graph constraints were introduced in the area of graph transformation,
in connection with the notion of (negative) application conditions, as
a form to limit the applicability of transformation rules. However, we
believe that graph constraints may also play a significant role in the
area of visual software modelling or in the specification and
verification of semi-structured documents or websites (i.e. HTML or
XML sets of documents). In this sense, after some discussion on these
application areas, we concentrate on the problem of how to prove the
consistency of specifications based on this kind of constraints. In
particular, we present proof rules for three classes of (increasingly
more powerful) graph constraints and show that our proof rules are
sound and (refutationally) complete for each class.

<BR>Specifying authentication protocols for pervasive and social computation.
<BR>Abstract:<BR> 
In this talk I described a new security landscape, arising from the
new pervasive technologies, such as Near Field Communication, which
place computational system components in physical space. Of particular
interest are the methods of authentication without any previous
security infrastructure, based on the physical properties of timed
channels, or on authenticated, low bandwidth social channels. While
such channels recently attracted a lot of attention in several
research communities, their properties and applications were analyzed
informally, since neither the usual symbolic models of secure systems,
nor the computational crypto models, support the needed refinement
mechanisms. I demonstrated incremental derivations, supported by
Protocol Derivation Assistant, of a family of distance-bounding
protocols, using timed channels, and of basic social authentication
protocols, using social channels.

<BR>Towards testing from CSP-CASL.
<BR>[Joint work with B-H Schlingloff, Berlin & T Kahsai, Swansea]
<BR>Abstract:<BR>
In this talk, we present a theory for the evaluation of test cases with
respect to formal specifications. In particular, we use the specification
language CSP-CASL to define and evaluate black-box tests for reactive
systems. Using loose semantics and three-valued test oracles, our approach is
well-suited to deal with the refinement of specifications. In a structured
development process of computational systems, abstract specifications are
gradually refined into more concrete ones. With our approach, it is possible
to develop test cases already from very abstract and basic specifications, and
to reuse them later on in more refined systems.

<BR>Free theorems for refinement.
<BR>Abstract:<BR>
In this paper we apply insights drawn from the use of parametricity
in second order lambda calculus, to facilitate proofs of refinements
via stable constructors between behavioral algebraic
specifications.Our final goal is to identify a setting to express
"theorems for free" in the style of Wadler for behavioral refinements.

<BR>Algebraic compilers and their implementation in Haskell
<BR>Abstract:<BR>
The construction of compilers with the help of algebra may now
celebrate its 40th anniversary. Big projects have followed the basic
ideas developed in the seventies of the last century. They are bound
to languages tailored to the view that compilation is
rewrite-rule-driven program transformation. This is, of course, an
adequate way of implementing compilers algebraically. Nevertheless, a
modern functional language like Haskell offers constructs
(polymorphism, data types, monads,...) that are at least equally
well-suited for writing algebraic compilers. In particular, the class
of all target languages (Sigma-algebras) of a given source language
(Sigma) can be implemented in Haskell as a single data type with
fields. This allows us to fully exploit the fact that (abstract)
syntax is initial semantics and thus a compiler is completely
determined by the extension of its target language to a
Sigma-algebra. We present the main definitions and illustrate the
Haskell coding of generic interpreters and compilers and their
instantiation by algebras at a small Java fragment.

<BR>Coalgebraic trace semantics for combined possibilitistic 
and probabilistic systems
<BR>Abstract:<BR>
Non-deterministic (also known as possibilistic) and probabilistic
state based systems (or automata) have been studied for quite some
time. Separately, they are reasonably well-understood.  The
combination however is difficult, both for conceptual and technical
reasons. Here we study the combination from a coalgebraic perspective
and identify a monad CM that captures the combination---following
work of Varacca. We use this monad to apply the coalgebraic framework
for (finite) trace semantics in this setting. It yields a smooth, but
not entirely trivial, description of traces.

<BR>An Object-Z/CSP based approach for the specification of architectural 
connectors.
<BR>[Joint work with Mourad Maouche, Philadelphia University, Jordan]
<BR>Abstract:<BR>
Our objective in this work is to propose a semantically safe
"combination" of Object-Z and CSP forspecifying architectural
connectors. The approach, which considers connectors as first-class
entities,intends to support incremental development of
specifications, as well as verification of properties. Westart from
the very informal definition that software architecture is a
collection of computationalcomponents together with a collection of
connectors, and follow the formal framework set by [1]. Inthis
framework a connector specification relies on the explicit definition
of the notions component,port, role, glue, connector, and
attachment.
<BR>
    In the suggested approach, roles, ports and glue, which as
considered as components, are specified(in the same way as
computational components) by Object-Z classes. The internal behavior
of thesecomponents is governed by preconditions on adequate state
variables. The behavior of the connector isspecified by a parallel
composition of the roles and their glue. The attachment of ports
(which arerefinements of roles) as roles is specified by a CSP
process parameterized by Object-Z classes.
<BR>
    The fact that both languages have common semantic basis 
[4, 5, 6, 7, and 8], enables using and / ordeveloping a unified method 
of refinement for the integrated notation.
<BR>
    Among the similar work we might cite: [1, 2, and 9]. 
In [1] all aspects of architectural connectorsare specified in a
CSP-like notation. [2], which abstracts of the notion of glue, defines
ports and rolesas basic types. In [9], connectors are categorical
entities, ports are not defined explicitly, andcomponents are seen as
refinement of roles.

<BR>Subobject transformation system and elementary net systems.
<BR>[Joint work with Frank Hermann and Pawel Sobocinski]
<BR>Abstract:<BR>
Subobject Transformation Systems (STS) are proposed as a novel formal
framework for the analysis of derivations of transformation systems
based on the algebraic, double-pushout approach.  They can be
considered as a simplified variant of DPO rewriting, acting in the
distributive lattice of subobjects of a given object of an adhesive
category. 
<BR><BR>
Interestingly, it turns out that STSs in the category of sets
with rules having empty interfaces correspond precisely to
Elementary Net System, a class of Petri nets widely studied in
the literature.
<BR><BR>
The formal setting of STSs allows a direct analysis of all possible
notions of dependency between any two productions without requiring an
explicit match.  In particular, several equivalent characterizations
of independence of productions are proposed, as well as a local
Church-Rosser theorem in the setting of STS. Also, we show how any
derivation tree in an ordinary DPO grammar leads to an STS via a
suitable construction, and we argue that relational reasoning in the
resulting STS is sound and complete with respect to the independence
in the original derivation tree.
<BR><BR>
From a methodological perspective, the relationship with ENSs could
provide challenging intuitions that could be generalized, at least in
part, to the more abstract setting of transformation systems over
adhesive categories.

<BR> A behavioural semantics for Petri nets (with an application to web  
services development).
<BR>[Joint work with Filippo Bonchi, Antonio Brogi and Sara Cortfini].
<BR>Abstract:<BR>
Web services are emerging as a promising technology for the
development of distributed heterogeneous software systems. In this
talk we first introduce a simple variant of standard condition/event
(C/E) Petri nets to naturally model the behaviour of Web services, and
in particular the persistency of data. Next step is the identification
of a suitable behavioural equivalence for our class of nets. Such an
equivalence is based on bisimilarity and inspired by recent advances
in the theory of reactive systems, more specifically, from the
relative pushouts methodology devised by Leifer and Milner. Hence, by
exploiting the firing relation we distill a set of labels, in order to
build a labelled reduction relation, such that the associated
behavioural notion of bisimilarity is a compositional equivalence. We
round up the talk by pointing out the main features of our proposal,
namely, weakness and decidability.

<BR>A logical approach to specify service-oriented application
<BR>[Joint work with Alessandro Fantechi, Alessandro Lapadula, Franco Mazzanti,
Rosario Pugliese and Francesco Tiezzi]
<BR>Abstract:<BR>
We introduce a logical verification framework for checking
functional properties of service-oriented applications formally
specified using the service specification language COWS. The
properties are described by means of Socl, a logic specifically
designed to capture peculiar aspects of services. Service behaviours
are abstracted in terms of Doubly Labelled Transition Systems, which
are used as the interpretation domain for Socl formulae. We
also illustrate the Socl model checker at work on a bank
service scenario specified in COWS

<BR> Graph minors and the analysis of graph transformation systems.
<BR>[Joint work with Salil Joshi, IIT Delhi]
<BR>Abstract:<BR>
We show how to view certain subclasses of (single-pushout) graph
  transformation systems as well-structured transition systems, which
  leads to decidability of the covering problem via a backward
  analysis. As the well-quasi order required for a well-structured
  transition system we use the graph minor ordering. We give an
  explicit construction of the backward step and apply our theory in
  order to verify a termination detection protocol.

<BR>Coalgebraic modal logic beyond rank 1.
<BR>[Joint work with Dirk Pattinson]
<BR>Abstract:<BR>
The semantics of modal logics applied in various areas of computer
science such as knowledge representation, decision making, or
multi-agent systems often deviates rather substantially from traditional
Kripke semantics. Coalgebraic modal logic has emerged as a suitable
generic semantic framework covering in particular also such non-normal
modal logics. Somewhat surprisingly, this framework supports also a
generic theory of (automated) modal reasoning; however, results in this
area have so far been limited to logics whose axioms do not nest modal
operators. Here, we present work aimed at overcoming this limitation,
i.e. we establish a generic method to obtain completeness,
decidability, and upper complexity bounds for logics defined by frame
conditions with nested modalities. Our method applies to classical
examples such as $K4$ and to certain conditional logics; as an extended
example, we moreover prove completeness and decidability of a
description logic with qualified number restrictions for descendancy
relations in tree-like structures.

<BR> A double-pushout approach for modeling pointer redirection
<BR>[Joint work with Rachid Echahed, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Prost]
<BR>Abstract:<BR>
The aim of this talk is to present a framework for data-structure
rewriting, including cyclic data-structures with pointers such as
circular lists, doubly-linked lists, etc.  Our framework follows the
categorical approach of the DPO (double pushout) method, but with
non-classical assumptions on rules and matchings. It allows local
pointer redirection, for redirecting some specific pointers, and
global pointer redirection, for redirecting all pointers with some
specific target to another target.
