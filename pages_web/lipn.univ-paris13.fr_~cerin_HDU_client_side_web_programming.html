    <h1>Client side web programming with Brython</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this lecture we will learn how to put in place a program
with <a href="https://www.brython.info/">Brython</a>, a client side
web programming tool. Brython is a Javascript library that interprets
  Python code, but not only. Its goals are mainly:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Instantly do interactive computation in using heavy UI widgets;</li>
  <li>To think "Browser-only web applications", powered by Python.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Python is more fun to write and is more readable than
  Javascript. However
  the <a href="https://tc39.github.io/">Javascript</a> specification
  is still evolving and it is part of a very large growing ecosystem
  (<a href="http://asmjs.org/">asm</a>,
  <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">dart</a> (see also
  a <a href="https://blog.codemagic.io/dart-vs-javascript/">comparison</a>
  between Dart and
  Javascript), <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">typescript</a>). Note
  that there exists many projects for Python-to-Javascript compilers:
  <ul>
      <li>Stand-alone compilers:
      <a href="https://github.com/PythonJS/PythonJS">PythonJS</a>,
      Pyjaco,
      Pyjamas,
      <a href="https://github.com/qsnake/py2js">Py2JS</a>;</li>
      <li>
      In-browser implementations:
      <a href="http://www.skulpt.org/">Skulpt</a>,
      Brython.</li></ul>
</li>

<p>A client side web application means that you download an html page
containing all the information to compute and to display the result of
your problem. There is no server, except a repository for your html
file. Your browser interprets the code inside the html file, and solve
  the problem!</p>

<p>The magic part is that the html file is divided into (virtual)
  sections of code as follows:</p>
<div>
<ol>
    <li>First it downloads a Python interpreter written in Javascript,
      plus, in general, a library of useful functions;</li>
    <li>Then, a Python section serves to implement the model of your
      application and problem to solve;</li>
    <li>Then, the code contains the view i.e. the description of
    buttons, text area... for interacting with the Python code, in
    order to transfer information from/to the graphical user
      interface;</li>
    <li>Then, the code contains the controller part i.e. the binding
    between the funtion/methods of your model with the butons, text
      area...</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<p>
  This type of organization is known under the vocabulary of MVC
  (Model View Controller). It is placed at the methodological level
  regarding the develpment of applications and may be useful for
  developing database applications (Mysql, Mariadb, Postgresql...) or
  GUI (Graphical User Interface) with JavaFX and Swing (Java tools),
  or in many other situations. The following frameworks also use an
  MVC approach: Angular (becoming very popular), Backbone, Ember,
  Knockout. Some complementary explanations about MVC can be found
  on <a href="https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/mobile-apps/the-model-view-controller-mvc-design-pattern/">this
  page</a>.</p>

<h2>Working with examples</h2>

<p>We recommend to download all the examples and to inspect the
codes. We put some comments inside the codes in order to discuss the
limitations of Brython. The portions of codes with a comment (</code>#
is used in Python to introduce a comment</code>) show alternatives
that are theoretically possible but, in general, not implemented yet
with Brython (for good and maybe for bad reasons too).
</p>

<p>The reader of this lecture is now invited to review, in depth, the
codes inside the following three examples in order to understand them
  according to the MVC principles:</p>
<span>
  <ol>
    <li>The <a href="https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~cerin/CIG-S1/multiens.html">Multiset</a>
    example. A multiset is a set with multiple occurences, if any, of
    the same elements. The implementation allows to add an element, to
    cancel one occurence, to cancel all the occurences... and to
    represent the multiset as a drawing. The multiset is initialized
    randomly with five integers. A Python class is introduced in order
      to group the methods for adding, cancelling...</li>
    <li>This <a href="https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~cerin/CIG-S1/brython_cerin.html">example</a>
    demonstrates how to fill a table and to play with a table;</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~cerin/HDU/weather_station.html">Weather
    Station</a> example demonstrates: <ol><li>how to post an ajax query
    to get information about the weather in different
    cities</li><li>how to draw tables, in a dynamic way, acconding to
    the number of days, per city, for the forecast</li><li>how to
    react the an event i.e. to bind an action to a list of checked
    buttons</li></ol> One problem with this application is that we
    can't POST a request outside our domain i.e. on the web, because
    of the sandboxing mechanism for the browser. Your browser and
    javascript follow the CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
    specification to protect against bad behaviors or intrusions. More
    information
    about <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/298745/how-do-i-send-a-cross-domain-post-request-via-javascript">CORS</a>
    can be found on the web, in particuar the way to set up your
    server to accept multi-domains requests. See also
    this <a href="http://restlet.com/company/blog/2015/12/15/understanding-and-using-cors/">excellent
    post</a> or this one on
    the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simples">Mozilla</a>
    web site. So, to download, from the web, the information about the
    weather, we developed
    a <a href="https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~cerin/HDU/weather_station.ps">Python
    3 script</a> that you have to install on your machine and to lanch
    before going to
    the <a href="https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~cerin/HDU/weather_station.html">Weather
    Station</a> example. The code of the Python program is in using
    the <code>requests</code> interface, for all the cities, and to
      store locally the results, on your local disk. The main loop is:
<pre>
  for i,_ in dico.items():
      print('We are creating the file named ',dico[i]+'_fr.xml -- Please wait!')
      data = requests.get('http://worldweather.wmo.int/fr/json/'+dico[i]+'_fr.xml')
      dataa=data.text
      j = json.loads(dataa)
      # Open a file
      fo = open(dico[i]+'_fr.xml', "w")
      foo = str(j)
      foo=foo.replace(": None", ": 'None'")
      foo=foo.replace(": False", ": 'False'")
      foo=foo.replace(": True", ": 'True'")
      # we put the anchor <cerin></cerin> in order to pre-build
      # an XML object that will be read by an ajax request in the
      # weather-station.html file. This is a Tip!
      fo.write("<cerin>"+foo+"</cerin>")
      # Close opend file
      fo.close()
</pre>
To conclude, we obtain two independant programs, that do not really
cooperate (only through files). The Python program generates the data
for the HTML code. The communication between the HTML code and the
'outside' of the browser is accomplished with an ajax POST
request. The Python program needs to be started daily if you want
fresh information about the weather!

<p><b>Special note:</b>
the <a href="https://www.brython.info/">Brython</a> web site contains
also many demos that can be considered to capture the main facilities
to implement user interfaces.</p>

<p><b>Special note:</b> the
  following <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/pyodide-bringing-the-scientific-python-stack-to-the-browser/">post</a>
  contains interesting information about client side web programming,
  notably a general discussion of issues, technical solution for
  implementing data science librairy inside the browser i.e. Bringing
  the scientific Python stack to the browser according to the viion of
  the <a href="https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/">Pyodide</a>
  project. Pyodide is the Python scientific stack, compiled to
  <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>. WebAssembly
  (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based
  virtual machine. Wasm is a core technology
  for <a href="https://github.com/iodide-project/iodide">Iodide</a>. Iodide
  is a modern, literate, and interactive programming environment that
  uses the strengths of the browser to let scientists work flexibly
  and collaboratively with minimal friction. In the same vein, the
  Nexedi team uses all of these technologies for
  the <a href="https://www.nexedi.com/erp5-Iodide.OfficeJS.Overview">OfficeJS
  Iodide</a> project, which is an ubiquitous Data Science Notebooks
  for Business and Education, running in the browser.</p>
