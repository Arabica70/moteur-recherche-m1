Practicing power plant engineers not only look after operation and maintenance of the plant, but, also look after range of activities including research and development, starting from power generation to environmental aspects of power plants. The book Thermal Power Plants - Advanced Applications introduces analysis of plant performance, energy efficiency, combustion, heat transfer, renewable power generation, catalytic reduction of dissolved oxygen and environmental aspects of combustion residues. This book addresses issues related to both coal fired and steam power plants.

existence. They are extremely successful though they are highly sensitive. They can be used as an environmental barometer. Amphibians significantly enhance our lives and our world in countless ways. They provide vital biomedicines, including compounds that are being refined for analgesics, antibiotics, stimulants for heart attack victims, and treatments for diverse diseases including depression, stroke, seizures, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, and cancer. The health of amphibians is commonly used to give a rough assessment of pollution levels in an area. Amphibians are believed to be sensitive to pollutants because of their highly permeable skins, and their varied lives, which maximize their exposure: Amphibians still give a comprehensive picture of the global environment that we need to consider.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey are hypersensitive to chemical pollution, habitat degradation, a variation of river and groundwater quality, climate change and even the sun&#39;s ultraviolet radiation, amphibians are among the vertebrate groups most endangered by human activity, and their abundance in wetlands is always one of the best indicators of good environmental conservation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this book, we have considered all aspects of amphibians biology, diversity, conservation and potential use of amphibians as environmental indicators.</p>",isbn:null,printIsbn:"979-953-307-X-X",pdfIsbn:null,doi:null,price:0,priceEur:0,priceUsd:0,slug:null,numberOfPages:0,isOpenForSubmission:!1,hash:"56a54f7a7f42b3e90257f5c8859a52ed",bookSignature:"Associate Prof. Suman Pratihar",publishedDate:null,coverURL:"https://cdn.intechopen.com/books/images_new/6997.jpg",keywords:"Biology of Amphibians, Frog, Toad, Metabolism, Hibernation, Adaptation, Environmental Pressure, UV radiation, Environmental Pollution, Biodiversity of Amphibians, Distribution, Habitat and Adaptability",numberOfDownloads:null,numberOfWosCitations:0,numberOfCrossrefCitations:0,numberOfDimensionsCitations:0,numberOfTotalCitations:0,isAvailableForWebshopOrdering:!0,dateEndFirstStepPublish:"April 23rd 2019",dateEndSecondStepPublish:"December 31st 2019",dateEndThirdStepPublish:"February 29th 2020",dateEndFourthStepPublish:"May 19th 2020",dateEndFifthStepPublish:"July 18th 2020",remainingDaysToSecondStep:"a month",secondStepPassed:!0,currentStepOfPublishingProcess:3,editedByType:null,kuFlag:!1,editors:[{id:"223034",title:"Associate Prof.",name:"Suman",middleName:null,surname:"Pratihar",slug:"suman-pratihar",fullName:"Suman Pratihar",profilePictureURL:"https://mts.intechopen.com/storage/users/223034/images/system/223034.png",biography:"Suman Pratihar,PhD,Zoology(Gold medelist) Vidyasagar University, interested in Molecular aspects of metabolic depression in hibernating anuran.

Resistance to antibiotics, to clarithromycin and metronidazole in particular, is a major factor contributing to failure of the therapy [<a href="#B3" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">3</a>, <a href="#B4" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">4</a>]; resistance to clarithromycin may lead to a decrease in efficiency to 70%, whereas the infection may persist up to about 20% of patients under treatment [<a href="#B5" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">5</a>]. Such limitations have resulted in development of alternative therapies - "rescue" therapies &ndash; using medicines which have not been used as a first or second intention, such as fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin) and rifabutin (a derivative of rifamycin), which are commonly used in treatment of mycobacterial infections and are also highly efficient against <em>H. pylori</em> [<a href="#B5" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">5</a>, <a href="#B6" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">6</a>]. </p><p id="P4">Quinolones have been the focus of considerable scientific and clinical interest, since their very development in the early 1960s. This happened because such drugs possess many of the attributes of an ideal antibiotic, combining high potency, a broad spectrum of activity, good bioavailability, oral and intravenous formulations, high serum levels, a large volume of distribution, indicating concentration on a tissue level and potential low incidence of adverse reactions. </p><p id="P5">Nalidixic acid was the first quinolone to be developed. Subsequent medicines have been derived by manipulation at the level of their side chain and nucleus [<a href="#B7" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">7</a>]. Development of the fluoroquinolone class may be described in terms of generations, each generation sharing similar characteristics or antimicrobial spectrum. The activity of first-generation medicines is more effective against gram-negative aerobic bacteria and less effective against gram-positive aerobic bacteria or anaerobic bacteria. Original fluoroquinolones are second-generation agents and they owe their name to the addition of a fluorine atom in the C6 position; they provide improved coverage against gram-negative bacteria and moderately improved coverage against gram-positive ones. Third-generation agents have greater efficacy against gram-positive bacteria, particularly against pneumococci, which is combined with good activity against anaerobic bacteria. Fourth generation fluoroquinolones provide superior coverage against pneumococci and anaerobic bacteria [<a href="#B8" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">8</a>]. </p></div><div class="section" id="sec_2" data-lvl="1"><h2 class="heading main-title">2. Clinical indications of fluoroquinolones</h2><p id="preF2">Fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin are indicated in: acute bacterial sinusitis (diagnosed according to national guidelines on treatment of infections of the respiratory tract and where use of antibacterial agents commonly recommended for initial treatment of this infection is considered inappropriate or in case of their failure to cure the infection), acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (diagnosed according to national guidelines on treatment of respiratory tract infections and where use of antibacterial agents commonly recommended for initial treatment of this infection is considered inappropriate or in case of their failure to cure the infection), community acquired pneumonia (where use of antibacterial agents commonly recommended for initial treatment of this infection is considered inappropriate), uncomplicated urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis), chronic bacterial prostatitis and skin and soft tissue infections. </p><figure class="media-panel" id="F2"><div class="media"><img src="/media/chapter/46480/media/image2.png" class="figure-link" alt=""></div><figcaption class="caption"><h4>Figure 2.</h4><p>Diseases involving Helicobacter pylori</p></figcaption></figure><p id="P7">At the same time, as mentioned before, fluoroquinolones are implicated in <em>H. pylori</em> eradication. Indications for a <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy are defined in consensus guidelines. These indications include peptic ulcer disease, low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis and after resection of early gastric cancer (<a href="#F2" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="fig">Figure 2)</a>. </p><p id="P8">The following are included in the <em>H. pylori</em> elimination:</p><p id="P9">First-line treatment: should be considered as the first-line therapy in areas with high prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> resistance to clarithromycin, in the frame of the new sequential ten-day scheme. Sequential therapy includes a dual therapy (proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin for five days), followed by triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and metronidazole for five days. The eradication rate achieved by sequential therapy has shown higher values, than those obtained with standard therapy [<a href="#B9" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">9</a>, <a href="#B10" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">10</a>]. However, sequential therapy has been shown ineffective in eradicating <em>H. pylori</em> in patients with dual resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole [<a href="#B11" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">11</a>, <a href="#B12" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">12</a>]. A new aspect of the scheme as concomitant therapy is a fourth medicine &ndash; a non-bismuth-containing regimen (proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, amoxicillin and metronidazole), which seems more appropriate for patients in highly endemic areas and with dual resistance. Clinically speaking, this is much easier than sequential therapy and can improve compliance, because medicines are administered concurrently, instead of changed in mid therapy An intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that sequential or concomitant therapy with a PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and an imidazole agent has similar rates for eradication of <em>H. pylori</em> infection [<a href="#B10" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">10</a>]. As far as dual resistance is concerned, several attempts have been made such as extension of sequential therapy and continuation with amoxicillin therapy for all 14 days, in order to improve effectiveness of standard triple therapy and proton pump inhibitors. A hybrid sequential-concomitant therapy has been recently designed by Hsu et al. [<a href="#B13" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">13</a>]. Data have shown promising success rate: 99% by per-protocol analysis and 97% by intention-to-treat analysis. However, it should be noted this may not be effective in all geographic areas and results will have to be confirmed in areas where different patterns of resistance are present. </p><p id="P10">Second-line therapy: bismuth is a component of quadruple therapy and/or rescue therapy recommended by the Maastricht IV/Florence Consensus Report [<a href="#B7" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">7</a>]. Several multicentre studies regarding quadruple therapy using a single triple medicine (bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline), in a capsule pharmaceutical formulation together with a proton pump inhibitor have shown good efficacy in <em>H. pylori</em> eradication [<a href="#B14" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">14</a>-<a href="#B16" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">16</a>]. With regard to adverse reactions, bismuth induced toxic effects are still one of the unnecessary safety concerns in relation to quadruple therapy [<a href="#B17" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">17</a>]; therefore, a reasonable bismuth dose regimen needs to be established to ensure maximum eradication. In patients where first-line treatment has failed, e.g., clarithromycin-based triple therapy, levofloxacine-based triple therapy (levofloxacin, amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor), a meta-analysis has shown this therapy to be superior to quadruple therapy and be accompanied by fewer adverse reactions than rescue therapy [<a href="#B18" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">18</a>]. In addition, the study has shown that antibiotics (e.g., levofloxacin) in this triple therapy should not be changed randomly and then switched to first-line treatment. As far as antibiotic resistance is concerned, growth rates of levofloxacin resistance, particularly in developing countries, are to be taken into account, since resistance to quinolones is related to the status of patients having used fluoroquinolones for other indications [<a href="#B19" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">19</a>]. </p><p id="P11">Third-line treatment: the third-line treatment standard for refractory <em>H. pylori</em> infection has not been established. The Maastricht IV/Florence Consensus Report recommends conducting anti-<em>H. pylori</em> therapy according to results of susceptibility testing after failure of second-line therapy, whenever possible [<a href="#B7" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">7</a>]. Unfortunately, antimicrobial sensitivity data for patients in whom eradication therapy has failed are not yet widely available in clinical practice. </p><p id="preT1">Practitioners need a few simple strategies for empirical management. A prospective study has assessed the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin, amoxicillin, bismuth and rabeprazole, as a quadruple therapy, with regard to third-line treatment in patients where eradication of <em>H. pylori</em> infection has failed. In this study, the ten-day quadruple rescue therapy, based on levofloxacin and amoxicillin, ensured better eradication with a significant additional clinical benefit involving improvement of tolerability due to fewer adverse reactions [<a href="#B18" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">18</a>]. Other alternative agents that are candidates for third-line treatment are rifabutin and quinolones, which also have promising results [<a href="#B20" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">20</a>-<a href="#B22" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">22</a>], although the optimal dose and the combination require further study (<a href="#T1" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="table">Table 1)</a>.

Safety of fluoroquinolones</h2><div class="section" id="sec_3_2" data-lvl="2"><h3 class="heading section-title">3.1. Overview</h3><p id="P13">As a class of medicines, fluoroquinolones are generally well tolerated; most adverse reactions are mild, self-limiting and rarely require treatment discontinuation [<a href="#B23" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">23</a>]. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions class consists of gastrointestinal trouble (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal pain, about 7% of all adverse reactions). Less common are adverse reactions include those involving the central nervous system (less than 5%), kidney disorders (approximately 4. 5%), skin hypersensitivity reactions and photosensitivity reactions (approximately 2%). In rare cases, convulsions, psychosis and tendonitis have been reported [<a href="#B24" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">24</a>]. Some of these events may not be directly attributed to fluoroquinolone therapy, but to other underlying conditions in the patient, including additional therapies not related to the microbial infection but still contributing to adverse reactions. Phototoxicity could be observed over a longer period in relation to administration of lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin and clinafloxacine, which has been determined to be a dose-dependent phenomenon requiring direct or indirect exposure to UVA rays and also closely correlated with the presence of a habide in the C8 position. </p><p id="P14">Serious adverse reactions have been developed following introduction to the use of the following three agents: temafloxacin, grepafloxacin and trovafloxacine. </p><p id="P15">Temafloxacin syndrome has been characterized by haemolytic anaemia, renal failure, hepatotoxicity, disseminated intravascular coagulation and hypoglycaemia [<a href="#B28" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">28</a>]. Approximately two thirds of patients with "temafloxacin syndrome" develop acute renal failure. In addition, slight hepatobiliary changes have been observed in half of patients, whereas coagulopathy has been observed in a third of patients. Development of such adverse reactions resulted in withdrawal of temafloxacin from the market in 1992 [<a href="#B26" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">26</a>]. Adverse reactions to temafloxacin not shown in the clinical trials conducted were observed at a rate of 1/3500 patients after placement on the market. In contrast, rare adverse reactions similar to those seen in temafloxacin have been reported with ciprofloxacin. This is significant, considering that ciprofloxacin has the largest database regarding fluoroquinolone safety information. Further analysis of such specific temafloxacin events have demonstrated that data involving norfloxacin and ofloxacin have been similar to those of ciprofloxacin. Specifically, such effects have been observed in 1/17000 patients treated with ciprofloxacin, in 1/25000 patients treated with norfloxacin and in 1/30000 patients treated with ofloxacin [<a href="#B25" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">25</a>]. </p><p id="P16">Grepafloxacin was placed on the market in 1997 and subsequently withdrawn in 1999 because of serious cardiovascular reports of adverse reactions in patients who had been administered this medicine [<a href="#B27" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">27</a>]. The association between grepafloxacin and serious cardiovascular adverse reactions became evident after extended clinical use. Starting with grepafloxacin placement on the market to its withdrawal in 1999, torsades de pointes were observed in 7/3.7 million patients [<a href="#B27" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">27</a>]. Trovafloxacin was authorized based on clinical efficacy trials conducted on batches including more than 6000 patients treated with this medicine. In these studies, 5% of patients discontinued trovafloxacin treatment because of adverse events, the most common of which included those on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract levels. As with temafloxacin, adverse reactions had not been clearly associated with use of the medicinal product before extended clinical use. Serious adverse reactions associated with trovafloxacin included liver eosinophilia and hypoglycaemia [<a href="#B29" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">29</a>], observed post-marketing. </p><p id="P17">All the adverse reactions described above have resulted in limiting the use of these medicines to hospital use only, in cases of severe life-threatening infections [<a href="#B29" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">29</a>]. Whereas withdrawal of temafloxacin and grepafloxacin from the market has raised concerns about the safety of fluoroquinolones, in considering the evaluation of their safety and efficacy, several aspects have required balancing. Despite rigorous preclinical studies, once a medicine is placed on the market for widespread clinical use, the likelihood of observing rare but serious adverse reactions is significantly increased [<a href="#B29" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">29</a>]. It is important to recognize the low incidence of adverse reactions and serious adverse reactions in other agents of the same class, which generally demonstrates the relative safety of this class of medicines [<a href="#B23" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">23</a>]. </p></div><div class="section" id="sec_4_2" data-lvl="2"><h3 class="heading section-title">3.2. Categorization of adverse effects</h3><p id="P18">Adverse reactions of levofloxacin consist of: disorders such as tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmia and torsades de pointes (reported predominantly in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation), ECG QT prolonged, leukopoenia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, neutropoenia, dizziness, headaches, drowsiness, convulsion, tremors, paraesthesia, vertigo, impaired hearing, bronchospasm, dyspnoea, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, flatulence, constipation, increased blood creatinine, rashes, pruritis, urticaria, tendon disorders including tendinitis (e.g., in the Achilles tendon), arthralgia, myalgia, anorexia, fungal infections (and proliferation of other resistant microorganisms), hypotension, asthenia, increased hepatic enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferas, alkaline phosphatise and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) and increased blood bilirubin [<a href="#B30" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">30</a>]. </p><p id="P19">Many of the fluoroquinolone adverse reactions are associated with quinolone pharmacore in positions one, seven and eight. In the following sections, the discussion focuses on class specific reactions regarding structural modifications in positions one, seven and eight [<a href="#B25" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">25</a>]. </p><p id="P20">Adverse reactions on the central nervous system level: although much information about the pathophysiology of fluoroquinolone induced central nervous system adverse reactions remain less well defined, one hypothesis suggests that drug interactions with the gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptor, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, may explain the stimulant effects at this level. </p><p id="P21">Affinity for the GABA receptor seems to be triggered by the R7 side chain substituent, unsubstituted piperazinyl and pyrrolidinyl moieties in particular. In this respect, agents with an unsubstituted piperazinyl ring (ciprofloxacin, enoxacine and norfloxacin) display high-affinity binding to GABA as well as interference with GABA binding to its receptor. It has been demonstrated that biphenyl acetic acid, which is an active metabolite of fenbufen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, enhances binding of fluoroquinolones to GABA receptors. </p><p id="P22">Concurrent administration of fenbufen and fluoroquinolones has been shown to be capable of inducing seizures in mice; certain researchers however have observed that alterations in GABA receptor binding mediated by quinolone are weak and may not fully explain reactions at the central nervous system level [<a href="#B31" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">31</a>]. It was noted that seven Japanese patients developed seizures following concurrent administration of enoxacine and fenbufen. Studies have also shown that penetration of quinolones at the CNS level does not seem to be correlated with the incidence of adverse reactions at this level [<a href="#B25" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">25</a>]. A possible understanding of such discrepancies is that fluoroquinolones may also induce excitatory effects by means of direct activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and adenosine-receptor mechanisms. It is therefore possible that the events mentioned may occur at this level only under special circumstances, when sufficient penetration is possible in the CNS, coupled with threshold antagonism of inhibitory pathways (GABA) and stimulation of excitatory pathways (NMDA, adenosine). </p><p id="P23">Ofloxacin and levofloxacin, its levorotatory isomer, have been observed to induce a number of adverse reactions at the central nervous system level, including headaches (9% ofloxacin, 6% levofloxacin), dizziness (5% ofloxacin, 3% levofloxacin) and less common events such as confusion, impaired thinking, insomnia and psychosis, in rare cases. Such reactions were induced even in the absence of concomitant medications such as NSAIDs [<a href="#B25" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">25</a>] and they tend to occur more frequently with ofloxacin than levofloxacin. </p><p id="P24">Genetic Toxicology: quinolones have been shown to inhibit mammalian cell topoisomerase II, a mechanism correlating with the occurrence of in vitro cytotoxicity, on the level of these cells [<a href="#B30" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">30</a>]. Substitutions and positions one, seven and eight have the greatest potential cytotoxicity and the effect is additive. However, chromosomal disruption or clastogenicity usually occurs only at very high concentrations of the medicine (300 to 10000 times the therapeutic dose) and in post-marketing studies was not shown to have carcinogenic potential. </p><p id="P25">Cardiovascular adverse reactions: cardiovascular adverse reactions, particularly prolongation of the heart rate corrected QT interval (the QTc interval) have been reported with quinolone therapy [<a href="#B30" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">30</a>]. Sparfloxacin increases the QTc interval in up to 3% of patients [<a href="#B32" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">32</a>]. Such significant results involving serious cardiac events have led to the withdrawal of grepafloxacin. Sparfloxacin is not recommended for administration in patients with a history of QT prolongation or patients receiving concomitant therapy likely to increase the interval, induce bradycardia or cause torsades de pointes (e.g., class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, bepridil, cisapride, erythromycin, terfenadine or tricyclic antidepressants). It seems possible that this effect may be more predictable with medicines administered concurrently with quinolones inhibiting cytochrome P450-mediated metabolizing, because of drug accumulation. So far, no specific structural change has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including those possibly affecting cytochrome P450-involving metabolism. Currently, the only possible specific structural changes that may be associated with increased incidence of serious cardiovascular events in relation to grepafloxacin or sparfloxacin therapy consist of a methyl or amino moiety in position C5 (of grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, respectively) [<a href="#B32" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">32</a>]. In light of experience acquired with sparfloxacin and grepafloxacin concerning adverse cardiovascular outcomes, more recent members of this class of medicines have been studied with particular focus on these reactions [<a href="#B30" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">30</a>]. </p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec_6" data-lvl="1"><h2 class="heading main-title">4. Basic antimicrobial activity</h2><div class="section" id="sec_6_2" data-lvl="2"><h3 class="heading section-title">4.1. Pharmacokinetics</h3><p id="P26">Fluoroquinolones have favourable pharmacokinetic properties, which have encouraged their extensive use. They are well absorbed and show good tissue penetration, which favours their use in many clinical syndromes. Whereas ciprofloxacin requires frequent administration, the long half-life of new generation fluoroquinolones allows use in daily single doses. </p><p id="P27">Most fluoroquinolones are eliminated renally. Moxifloxacin elimination involves the liver and this is one of the fluoroquinolones lacking effectiveness in treatment of genitourinary infections. In general, because they are not as highly bound to plasma proteins and because of CYP1A2 enzyme-limited inhibition of CYP450, drug interactions are somewhat minimized [<a href="#B33" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">33</a>-<a href="#B35" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">35</a>]. Fluoroquinolones have been shown to interact with xanthines, theophylline and caffeine, which is matter of concern with older generation agents [<a href="#B36" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">36</a>]. Concurrent use of fluoroquinolone and warfarin may result in excessive anticoagulation [<a href="#B37" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">37</a>]. Probably the most common interactions involve cationic di- and trivalents. Administration with antacids may result in subtherapeutic fluoroquinolone levels, thus raising potential therapeutic failure. This may be particularly relevant in an "inpatient setting", because of the frequent fluoroquinolone and antacids association; co-administration of agents mentioned previously has raised the issue of emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones [<a href="#B38" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">38</a>, <a href="#B39" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">39</a>]. </p><p id="P28">In terms of levofloxacin involved in <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy, oral administration is rapidly and almost completely followed by levofloxacin absorption, with a peak concentration achieved within one hour. Absolute bioavailability is approximately 100% and food has a low impact on levofloxacin absorption. </p><p id="P29">Approximately 30-40% of levofloxacin is bound to plasmatic proteins and a therapy involving a 500mg dose once daily for several days has shown non-significant accumulation. However, there is modest but predictable accumulation after therapy involving 500mg twice daily, with a balance reached within three days. Levofloxacin metabolism is very scarce and its metabolites are "desmethyl-levofloxacine" and "levofloxacin N-oxide". These metabolites contribute to less than 5% of the urine-excreted dose. Levofloxacin is stereochemically stable and undergoes no chiral inversion. Following oral or intravenous administration, levofloxacin is relatively slowly eliminated from plasma (t1/2 = 6-8 hours). The chief route of excretion is mainly renal (&gt;85% of the dose administered). There are no major differences in levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in terms of oral versus intravenous administration, which leads to the conclusion that oral and intravenous administration are interchangeable. </p></div><div class="section" id="sec_7_2" data-lvl="2"><h3 class="heading section-title">4.2. Pharmacodynamics</h3><p id="P30">Pharmacokinetics (PK) regards the time course of antimicrobial concentrations in the body; on the other hand, pharmacodyamics (PD) provides insight into the relationship between such concentrations and the effect on antimicrobial level. </p><p id="P31">Traditionally, doses of antibiotic therapeutic schemes only determined the pharmacokinetics; however, pharmacodynamics plays an equally, if not more important, role. </p><p id="P32">In this period of increased antimicrobial resistance, pharmacodynamics is becoming perhaps the most important because it can be used in the design of a dosage regimen to prevent resistance [<a href="#B40" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">40</a>, <a href="#B41" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">41</a>]. </p><p id="P33">The primary parameter of antibiotic activity is the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). MIC is the lowest concentration of an antibiotic able to completely inhibit in vitro microorganism growth. Whereas MIC is a reliable indicator of antibiotic potency, it has no relevance in terms of the time course of antimicrobial activity. </p><p id="P34">Pharmacokinetic parameters quantify the time course of an antibiotic level. The three pharmacokinetic parameters most important in evaluating effectiveness of the antibiotic are the peak serum level (Cmax), the minimum level (Cmin) and the area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC). Whereas these parameters quantify the serum level over a certain period of time, they describe the destruction activity of an antibiotic. </p><p id="P35">Integration of pharmacokinetic parameters and MIC provides three pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters quantifying the activity of an antibiotic: the peak/MIC ratio, the T&gt;MIC and the ratio 24h-AUC/MIC</p><ul><li><p id="L1">the peak / MIC ratio is Cmax divided by MIC </p></li><li><p id="L2">the T&gt;MIC (time above MIC) is the percentage of a dosing interval when the serum level reaches MIC </p></li><li><p id="L3">the 24h-AUC/MIC ratio is determined by dividing the 24-hour-AUC by MIC [<a href="#B40" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">40</a>, <a href="#B41" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">41</a>].</p></li></ul><p id="P36">The three pharmacodynamic properties of antibiotics best describing the destruction activity are time-dependent, concentration-dependent and the presence of persistent effects. The destruction rate is determined by either the time needed for destruction (time-dependent) or the effect of increased concentration (concentration-dependent). Persistent effects include post-antibiotic effect, which is the persistence of suppression of bacterial growth after exposure to antibiotics. </p><p id="P37">For fluoroquinolones, the best dosing regimen would maximize the concentration, as higher concentrations cause a superior and faster degree of destruction, therefore the "24h-AUC/MIC ratio" and the "peak/MIC ratio" are important predictors for antibiotic efficacy. </p><p id="P38">In this case, as far as fluoroquinolones are concerned, the "24h-AUC/MIC ratio" for Gram-negative bacteria (<em>H. pylori</em> included) is about 125 and 40, respectively, for Gram-positive bacteria. For Gram-negative bacteria, however, the "24h-AUC/MIC ratio" for the group of medicines described above, the reports vary widely in the literature [<a href="#B40" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">40</a>, <a href="#B41" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">41</a>]. </p></div><div class="section" id="sec_8_2" data-lvl="2"><h3 class="heading section-title">4.3.

Interaction with bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV</h3><p id="P47">From among antimicrobial agents in common clinical use, fluoroquinolones are the only class that directly inhibit synthesis of bacterial DNA. There are two bacterial enzymes with distinct and essential roles in DNA replication, called DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are inhibited by fluoroquinolones. The respective process involves binding quinolones to the complex with DNA of each such enzyme, which results in a ternary complex of topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA. Subsequently, this complex induces the generation of double-stranded breaks in DNA, further blocking progress of the DNA replication enzyme complex. </p><p id="P48">The final result of this action is damaged bacterial DNA and ultimately death of bacterial cells [<a href="#B48" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">48</a>-<a href="#B51" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">51</a>]. </p><p id="P49">The responsibility for quinolones resistance lies with mutation in chromosomal genes. This occurs by means of two mechanisms: the altered target mechanism, on one hand, involving encoding DNA-gyrase and topoisomerase IV subunits and the altered permeation mechanism, on the other hand, regulating expression of proteins or cytoplasmic membrane efflux pumps, both of which make up the channels for outer membrane diffusion. </p><p id="P50">A further mechanism for the generation of low-level quinolone resistance has been considered, reduced target expression [<a href="#B52" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">52</a>]. </p></div><div class="section" id="sec_11_2" data-lvl="2"><h3 class="heading section-title">5.2. Response of the SOS gene network</h3><p id="P51">Inhibition of bacterial type II topoisomerases activates repair mechanisms in response. This is because each piece of DNA damage activates an SOS gene network, which initiates the generation of repair proteins of various kinds [<a href="#B53" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">53</a>-<a href="#B57" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">57</a>]. There are over 40 genes making up this so-called SOS system, which is under the control of regulatory RecA and LexA proteins. The former is in charge of generating a signal triggering the SOS response, whereas the latter has a repressor function. The process consists of gene repressor LexA binding, which results in the unmasking of its autoproteolytic activity and subsequent ending of repression of the 40 SOS genes. The respective LexA binding takes place in the sequence up from qnrB (but not qnrS or qnrA). Therefore, in response to DNA damage, the SOS-system regulates qnrB as well [<a href="#B58" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">58</a>]. Furthermore, the SOS response has recently been shown to promote qnrB expression [<a href="#B59" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">59</a>]. </p><p id="P52">Bacterial DNA-topoisomerases are protected from quinolone inhibition by the QnrB peptide, which also renders low-level resistance to quinolone. On the contrary, high-level resistance emerges with facilitation of the Qnr-determinants. It should also be noted that, in the case of <em>E. coli</em>, this particular effect directly depends on the increased ability for mutation due to action of nonessential polymerases Pol II, Pol IV and Pol V over the de-repression of the genes polB, dinB and umuDC, respectively, mediated by the LexA-cleavage. </p><p id="P53">In this way, the same signal of the SOS response triggers both increased mutation ability and qnrB-mediated quinolone resistance. </p><p id="P54">Because of the RecA/LexA-dependent manner in which ciprofloxacin upregulates the qnrB quinolone resistance gene, the development of quinolone resistance is integral to their action mode in bacteria harbouring qnrB. </p><p id="P55">LexA positive wild-type strains are much more liable to elicit ciprofloxacin resistant mutants than their mutant counterparts [<a href="#B60" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">60</a>, <a href="#B61" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">61</a>].

In 100% of levofloxacin resistant isolates there have been observed mutations in both position 91 and 87. In addition, a new mutation has been identified, which consists of Tyr substituting Asn in position 87. Position 86 (Asp86Asn) is involved in infrequent mutations; the same position usually associates with mutations at positions 87 and 91, which diminishes its role in MIC values. In a similar manner, it is most likely that gyrB constantly associating with gyrA 87-91 mutations reduce to a minimum the role gyrB mutations hold in emergence of quinolone resistance. Actually, the involvement of gyrA and gyrB gene mutations has been observed in levofloxacin resistance as 83.8% and 4.4%, respectively. </p><p id="P120">There are also other factors that are involved in levofloxacin resistance, such as occurrence in codon 87 of gyrA of an amino acidic polymorphism, which consists of the presence of various asparagine-threonine residues. Specifically, presence of threonine in the J99 strain and asparagine residues in the 26695 strain associated with a higher antibiotic susceptibility has been identified due to the complete sequencing genome of two strains, namely the J99 and the 26695. Other Helicobacter types interestingly preserve the presence of threonine residue in codon 87, which therefore indicates the likelihood of the occurrence of a &ldquo;philogenic&rdquo; type evolution of the Helicobacter species. </p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec_15" data-lvl="1"><h2 class="heading main-title">6.

Identification of and subsequent familiarisation with plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) has revealed a new and more dangerous mechanism of resistance allowing bacteria to adapt to and survive therapeutic concentrations of fluoroquinolones. As mentioned above, PMQR only provides low-level resistance, not enough to enable classification as clear resistance (MIC &ge;4g/ml), according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoint criteria for quinolone resistance. With these low MICs, such isolates, although transporting mutations conferring low sensitivity to quinolones, are to be classified as sensitive (MIC &ge;1g/ml), meaning that physicians can further prescribe this class of medicines. </p><p id="P122">This in itself is a dilemma, because PMQR allows such &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; organisms to survive even under therapeutic concentrations, easily circulating their genes afterwards. Continued exposure to these antibiotics determines high selection for plasmid-carrying pathogens, then rapidly conducing to general development of high-level clinically significant degrees of resistance. It has been shown that PMRQ-conferred low resistance levels can still remain undetected by current CLSI criteria and therefore are still conducive to failure of therapy. This is reason for concern with regard to the safety of prescribing fluoroquinolones for treatment of PMRQ gene-bearing organisms, even if they do not qualify as &ldquo;resistant&rdquo;. </p><p id="P123">In such cases, the problem arises whether clinical breakpoints should be reviewed with regard to plasmid-carrying pathogens. </p><p id="P124">There is a strong association between fluoroquinolone resistance and resistance to other antibiotics, particularly wide spectrum &beta;-lactamases and aminoglycosides. This indicates that gene-carrying plasmid organisms conferring quinolone resistance increase the likelihood of developing multi-drug resistant bacteria and prescription of a quinolone may be selective of not only quinolone resistance but also resistance to other classes of medicines. </p><p id="P125">The discovery of plasmid-mediated resistance genes in some non-Typhi serotypes of Salmonella enterica in animals has raised a major public health concern. The presence of such resistance genes from plasmid-mediated resistance genes in some non-Typhi serotypes of Salmonella enterica suggests an unsettling potential for horizontal transmission of resistance genes among animals and of infection-causing human pathogens, by means of food. Fluoroquinolone resistance prolongs hospitalisation and may further determine complications because of the selected therapy. The following can be mentioned among strategies implemented in some geographic areas: prohibited use as animal food and restricted use of fluoroquinolones in agriculture and their use for therapeutic purposes only, development of programmes for antibiotics management in hospitals (by drug rotation, cycling and restriction) as well as carrying out educational campaigns addressing physicians and patients, whose aim should be to increase awareness of inappropriate antibiotics. </p><p id="P126">The current breakpoints allow continuation of the quinolone treatment, whereas the organisms carrying these plasmid-mediated resistance genes remain undetected, which results in further dissemination of these plasmids, because of the selection pressure. The aim is a review of CLSI quinolone and fluoroquinolone breakpoints, against the background of the new mechanism (PMQR). Lower clinical breakpoints will help physicians to detect the low-level-resistance phenotype as rendered by such genes as well as avoidance of resumed prescription of quinolones as a treatment. </p><p id="P127">Identification of the PMQR mechanism is indicative of an increased risk of spreading resistance not only to fluoroquinolones but also, because of co-transmission, to other significant antimicrobial classes. Tackling this issue by judicious use of antibacterials and re-evaluation of clinical breakpoints will constitute an important step in preserving the efficiency of this important class of medicines. </p><p id="P128">Concerning the <em>H. pylori</em> infection, an encouraging strategy to approach cases of multiple failures in prior <em>H. pylori</em> eradication is quinolone-based treatment as a rescue therapy. According to European guidelines, before selecting a third-line treatment, which is based on microbial sensitivity to antibiotics, culture is recommended. Quinolones for third-line therapy should be selected based on results of drug susceptibility tests or analysis of gyrA. </p><p id="P129">If available, further alternatives have also been suggested for rescue therapy, consisting of furazolidone-based therapy, triple rifabutin-based therapy or high-dose amoxicillin/PPI therapy. </p></div>\n',keywords:null,chapterPDFUrl:"https://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/46480.pdf",chapterXML:"https://mts.intechopen.com/source/xml/46480.xml",downloadPdfUrl:"/chapter/pdf-download/46480",previewPdfUrl:"/chapter/pdf-preview/46480",totalDownloads:1784,totalViews:712,totalCrossrefCites:0,totalDimensionsCites:1,hasAltmetrics:0,dateSubmitted:"September 18th 2013",dateReviewed:"September 19th 2013",datePrePublished:null,datePublished:"April 3rd 2014",readingETA:"0",abstract:null,reviewType:"peer-reviewed",bibtexUrl:"/chapter/bibtex/46480",risUrl:"/chapter/ris/46480",book:{slug:"trends-in-helicobacter-pylori-infection"},signatures:"Carolina Negrei and Daniel Boda",authors:[{id:"169515",title:"Dr.",name:"Carolina",middleName:null,surname:"Negrei",fullName:"Carolina Negrei",slug:"carolina-negrei",email:"carol_n2002@hotmail.com",position:null,institution:null},{id:"169516",title:"Dr.",name:"Daniel",middleName:null,surname:"Boda",fullName:"Daniel Boda",slug:"daniel-boda",email:"daniel.boda@yahoo.com",position:null,institution:null}],sections:[{id:"sec_1",title:"1.

Introduction</h2>\n<p id="p2">Wound healing represents a major challenge in medicine due to its complexity and potential severity. It is a sequential process that requires the perfect interaction of many factors and cell types. As is well known, the key aspects in wound healing are the growth of granulation tissue and the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes at the edges of the wound. For this, a series of cytokines and growth factors arriving from blood and others produced locally, act in an autocrine or paracrine manner, orchestrating the communication between cells and regulating the healing process [<a href="#B1" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">1</a>, <a href="#B2" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">2</a>, <a href="#B3" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">3</a>, <a href="#B4" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">4</a>]. In the normal repair of a tissue, the resident cells have the mission of producing these cytokines and growth factors that cooperate in their repair function. In fact, it has been discovered that some of them promote cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) [<a href="#B5" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">5</a>]. Therefore, the direct application in the wound of specific stimulating peptides is expected to increase the healing of chronic ulcers until now considered as incurable.</p>\n<p id="p3">We currently know that growth hormone (GH) is a pleiotropic factor capable of acting positively in many organs and tissues. For years, the use of GH for wound healing has been investigated [<a href="#B6" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">6</a>, <a href="#B7" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">7</a>]. For example, the use of recombinant human GH as an anabolic treatment in burns to accelerate wound healing is already classic [<a href="#B8" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">8</a>, <a href="#B9" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">9</a>]. Patients with severe burns who were treated with systemic GH improved both their healing and their survival [<a href="#B10" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">10</a>, <a href="#B11" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">11</a>]. More recently, a number or studies have shown that GH is a promising agent in the acceleration of wound healing [<a href="#B12" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">12</a>, <a href="#B13" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">13</a>]. In addition to the stimulation of granulation tissue formation, GH increases collagen deposition, and facilitates epithelialization [<a href="#B14" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">14</a>, <a href="#B15" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">15</a>]. This effect of GH has been seen in experimental models of undernourished rats, in which the administration of the hormone made the granulation tissue to grow in previously induced wounds [<a href="#B16" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">16</a>]. Similar results have been found in GH-transgenic mice models [<a href="#B17" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">17</a>]. Although contradictory data can be found in the literature on this particular action of GH, most studies support its benefit, and evidence of its positive effects (<a href="#tab1" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="table">Table&nbsp;1</a>) will be described widely later in the text. It should be noticed that GH activation normally is produced in morbid conditions as catabolic or chronic diseases, and it may have no effect in healthy subjects. For example, when we artificially produce an injury in normal individuals, there are no differences about the speed of wound healing between GH-treated subjects and controls [<a href="#B18" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">18</a>]. Furthermore, some data suggest that systemic GH treatment is detrimental for wound healing in healthy individuals [<a href="#B19" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">19</a>]. The same is found in healthy people if we try to stimulate the immune system with GH [<a href="#B20" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">20</a>]. There is much evidence to support an angiogenic effect of GH in patients with critical limb ischemia that suffer usually from ischemic ulcers; or its benefit in aging or in diabetes mellitus (DM) [<a href="#B21" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">21</a>, <a href="#B22" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">22</a>]. The latter data show the specific role that the hormone can play depending on the morbid condition of the patient. <a href="#F1" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="fig">Figures&nbsp;1</a>&ndash;<a href="#F3" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="fig">3</a> show the evolution of a patient with critical ischemia of the lower limbs, suffering from an ulcer, before and after 8 weeks of treatment with subcutaneous GH administration (0.4 mg/day).</p>\n<div class="table-wrap" id="tab1"><div class="table-content"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups">\n<col>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ol style="list-style-type: alpha-upper;"><li><p id="p5">Inflammation phase</p><ul><li><p id="p6">Stimulates the recruitment of inflammatory cells: monocytes and T-lymphocytes by increasing MCP-1, without changing neutrophil count.</p></li><li><p id="p7">Diffuse wound occupation of inflammatory cells.</p></li></ul></li><li><p id="p8">Proliferation phase: granulation tissue formation (dose-dependent)</p><ul><li><p id="p9">Diffuse wound occupation of fibroblasts and myofibroblast.</p></li><li><p id="p10">Increase fibroblasts proliferation along with total collagen deposition.</p></li><li><p id="p11">Increase secretion of ECM: scaffold function.</p></li><li><p id="p12">Increase proliferation and migration of keratinocytes, accelerating epithelization.</p></li><li><p id="p13">Angiogenesis:</p><ul><li><p id="p14">Boosts the formation of capillaries.</p></li><li><p id="p15">Directly, or indirectly: VEGF, FGF, or SDF-1.</p></li><li><p id="p16">Attraction of endothelial cells from the bone marrow.</p></li></ul></li><li><p id="p17">It could improve neurogenic response.</p></li><li><p id="p18">High doses of GH can delay wound closure (overgrowth of granulation tissue).</p></li></ul></li><li><p id="p19">Remodeling phase</p><ul><li><p id="p20">Accelerates the remodeling of the granulation tissue.</p></li></ul></li></ol>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><div class="table-caption"><h3 class="heading">Table&nbsp;1.</h3><div class="text"><p id="p21">Key points about evidence of GH and wound healing.</p></div><div class="text"></div></div></div>\n<figure class="media-panel" id="F1"><div class="media"><img src="/media/chapter/64089/media/F1.png" class="figure-link" alt=""></div><figcaption class="caption"><h4>Figure&nbsp;1.</h4><p>Five&nbsp;minutes reactive hyperemia test.

Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and Ghrelin are some of the most important factors controlling not only the synthesis and release of GH from the pituitary gland, but also regulating the GH receptor (GHR) and its function [<a href="#B23" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">23</a>, <a href="#B24" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">24</a>]. As it will be detailed further, both hormones have also been described as having the ability to improve the healing process. Although this is not the aim of this review, at this point we cannot forget the association between Klotho and the GH/IGF-1 axis [<a href="#B22" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">22</a>], especially during aging.</p>\n<p id="p26">The key problem is to find the best way for the hormone to be administered, and the best vehicle to carry it out. However, while for GH both systemic and local administration have been demonstrated to be effective in the healing of wounds, in the case of IGF-1, the main mediator of GH actions, systemic, unlike local use, has no effect, probably because GH can have direct actions that are added to its indirect actions stimulating other growth factors involved in wound healing. It has to be highlighted that the concentration of GH, when applied locally, and the dose, when a systemic administration is chosen, are also of importance and may determine the final effect and/or the appearance of complications. Systemic GH may increase the collagen production and mechanical strength of wounds [<a href="#B15" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">15</a>, <a href="#B25" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">25</a>]. It has been reported that systemic GH administration could accelerate the split-thickness skin defect in pigs [<a href="#B7" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">7</a>]. However, systemic use of GH may induce side effects that must be considered when using this way. Such collateral effects are dependent on dose and time of administration. Although the topical use of GH seems to be better to reduce the possibility of side effects, unfortunately, this way of administration also present some deficiencies. Nevertheless, GH therapy has also the advantage of its relatively low cost. To produce growth factors for medical use in nonhealing wounds is costly, and hence, increasing the production of these factors by local GH administration, could be more cost-effective.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="section" id="sec_2" data-lvl="1">\n<h2 class="heading main-title">2. Experimental and clinical evidences of GH action on wound healing</h2>\n<p id="p27">GH actions on wound healing have been evaluated in different studies from the macroscopic and microscopic points of view.</p>\n<p id="p28">During the inflammatory phase of skin wounds in mice, GH stimulated the recruitment of inflammatory cells after 3&nbsp;days of topical treatment, allowing to improve the degradation of the injured tissue [<a href="#B26" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">26</a>]. Monocytes, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and T-lymphocytes play a key role in the control of the healing process. GH is a strong inductor of these cells [<a href="#B27" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">27</a>, <a href="#B28" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">28</a>, <a href="#B29" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">29</a>] and activates human monocyte chemotaxis and migration [<a href="#B29" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">29</a>]. A low dose of exogenous GH administration induces the expression of MCP-1 mRNA up to eight-fold [<a href="#B28" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">28</a>]. However, as it will be described further, the stimulation of these immune cells by GH not only benefits inflammatory phase, but also angiogenic and neurogenic responses [<a href="#B19" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">19</a>]. After analyzing the areas of wounds in the inflammatory phase when GH is used topically in mice, GH-treated mice increased the number of macrophages by about 15%, and the number of lymphocytes by 50% without changing neutrophil recruitment [<a href="#B26" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">26</a>].</p>\n<p id="p29">The effects of GH on the immune system have been extensively analyzed. In a model of peritonitis, GH reduced bacterial counts in the peritoneal layer and increased the number of exudative neutrophils [<a href="#B30" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">30</a>]. Furthermore, GH increases the thymic mass in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the number of CD4+ T-lymphocytes [<a href="#B31" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">31</a>]. In these cases, GH was able to restore immune function.</p>\n<p id="p30">A study in male mice in which an incision wound occurred showed that local administration of GH led to increased cellular infiltration in the wound area, mainly occupied by inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts, while in the control group (who did not receive the hormone) this type of cellular infiltration was only observed at the edges of the wound. This finding indicates that GH, directly or indirectly, had accelerated the migration and recruitment of cells, such as fibroblasts, to the site of injury [<a href="#B26" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">26</a>].</p>\n<p id="p31">Fibroblasts play a key role in all aspects of this process. In response to early injury signals, fibroblasts proliferate and migrate into the wound. They significantly contribute to the synthesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM), providing a scaffold for cellular ingrowth [<a href="#B32" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">32</a>]. In addition, fibroblasts secrete various important cytokines with both autocrine and paracrine effects [<a href="#B33" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">33</a>, <a href="#B34" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">34</a>, <a href="#B35" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">35</a>, <a href="#B36" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">36</a>]. This concept is schematized in <a href="#F4" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="fig">Figure&nbsp;4</a>.</p>\n<figure class="media-panel" id="F4"><div class="media"><img src="/media/chapter/64089/media/F4.png" class="figure-link" alt=""></div><figcaption class="caption"><h4>Figure&nbsp;4.</h4><p>Schematic description of the effects of GH on a wound during the early inflammatory process and stages after it. Lastly, GH also induces the acceleration of the granulation tissue and the wound is healed. Blue arrows indicate stimulation.</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p id="p33">The role of GH in accelerating the granulation tissue has been described in previous work [<a href="#B37" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">37</a>]. The cell recruitment along with collagen deposition was also accelerated in response to GH during the phase of granulation tissue. An increased mitosis and migration of keratinocyte were found after 7&nbsp;days of the incision in mice treated with the hormone, parallel to the secretion of ECM to give consistency to the aforementioned granulation tissue [<a href="#B26" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">26</a>]. In this study, it was observed that GH accelerated the migration and proliferation of these cells already in the first week of treatment [<a href="#B26" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">26</a>], but also the analysis of the samples showed that topical treatment with GH, regardless of the concentration used, increased the total collagen deposition after 7 and 14&nbsp;days of treatment. That is, GH therapy not only accelerated the remodeling of the granulation tissue, but also the epithelization, with a more stratified epidermis. Another study showed that the systemic application of GH stimulated the formation of granulation tissue in wounds of malnourished rats [<a href="#B16" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">16</a>].</p>\n<p id="p34">In vitro studies on plates coated with Matrigel<sup>&reg;</sup> with endothelial cells have shown that GH produces a mitogen effect, which affects cell morphology, increases ECM and boosts the formation of structures similar to capillaries [<a href="#B38" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">38</a>]. Some data supporting the action of GH on collagen deposition have been described in patients with acromegaly, in whom the excess of GH determines severe cardiac damage with fibrosis [<a href="#B22" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">22</a>].</p>\n<p id="p35">The role of GH in fibroblast proliferation is crucial for the wound healing process [<a href="#B39" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">39</a>]. In one study, when GH was applied topically, fibroblast proliferation increased significantly, as indicated by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay. However, the increase in proliferation differed according to the concentration of GH, being 2.5&nbsp;IU/L the best dose to stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts [<a href="#B40" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">40</a>].</p>\n<p id="p36">Angiogenesis plays a key role during the granulation phase and tissue remodeling, as new vessels are required for the progression of wound healing. Endothelial cells express the GHR [<a href="#B41" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">41</a>], and the participation of GH in the latter process has been widely demonstrated and reviewed [<a href="#B21" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">21</a>, <a href="#B22" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">22</a>, <a href="#B42" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">42</a>]. Moreover, GH-transgenic mice show an increase in blood vessels during tissue repair [<a href="#B19" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">19</a>].</p>\n<p id="p37">GH can act directly on endothelial cells through the GHR, or indirectly, by increasing others growth factors such as VEGF, FGF, or SDF-1; in this way, the hormone facilitates the proliferation, migration, and formation of endothelial cell tubes, as well as the attraction of that type of cells from the bone marrow through the CXCR4 receptor for SDF-1 [<a href="#B43" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">43</a>].</p>\n<p id="p38">The formation of blood vessels is already observed 7&nbsp;days after the local administration of GH in mice. Again, the dose utilized is important, since at 10<sup>&minus;7</sup>&nbsp;M doses of GH a higher number of blood vessels was produced in the granulation tissue, compared to the control group and the group treated with GH 10<sup>&ndash;8</sup>&nbsp;M [<a href="#B26" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">26</a>]. A similar effect was also observed after 14&nbsp;days of treatment, indicating that GH maintained its proangiogenic effect during the 2&nbsp;weeks of application.</p>\n<p id="p39">All these results point out that GH is a member of those molecules that have pleiotropic actions on skin cells, and confirm previous research showing that after an injury to the skin, the process of wound healing is accelerated in GH-transgenic mice overexpressing GH [<a href="#B19" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">19</a>]. In the latter study, full-thickness incisional and excisional wounds developed a highly vascularized granulation tissue. However, the bursting strength of these injuries did not increase. In these injured mice, wound closure was even delayed as a result of increased granulation tissue formation, demonstrating that, on one hand, GH can grow this essential tissue for healing, but on the other hand, at high doses, the overgrowth of granulation tissue can even delay wound closure. The authors of this study also support the fact that this action of GH on healing is probably not mediated via IGF-1 [<a href="#B19" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">19</a>], in contrast to previous studies that hypothesized a direct role of IGF-1, induced by GH, in healing wounds [<a href="#B44" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">44</a>, <a href="#B45" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">45</a>]. Currently, many evidences support the fact that circulating IGF-1 does not affect the wound, but that IGF-1 produced locally by fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelial cells is the responsible for wound healing [<a href="#B46" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">46</a>, <a href="#B47" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">47</a>]. Nevertheless, topically applied GH also increases the concentration of IGF-1 mRNA in the granulation tissue in&nbsp;vivo [<a href="#B48" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">48</a>]. In any case, if the effect of IGF-1 on wound healing occurs as a consequence of the local production of IGF-1, induced by GH within the wound, it is equally important the fact that the topical administration of GH can facilitate the healing of wounds.</p>\n<p id="p40">Furthermore, as it will be described later, some of the hormones related to the control of GH secretion, as GHRH and Ghrelin, have also shown positive effects on wound healing, showing, once again, the strong influence of GH on wound healing.</p>\n<div class="section" id="sec_2_2" data-lvl="2">\n<h3 class="heading section-title">2.1.

The JAK/STAT signaling pathway</h4>\n<p id="p41">The Janus kinase (JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is considered one of the most relevant intracellular signaling pathways utilized by hormones, growth factors, and cytokines to carry out their cellular actions [<a href="#B49" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">49</a>], and it is also involved in wound healing [<a href="#B50" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">50</a>]. Cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis are mediated by this pathway [<a href="#B51" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">51</a>]. When its control is altered, this promotes chronic inflammation.</p>\n<p id="p42">Basically, the regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway is carried out by various mechanisms such as tyrosine phosphatase, internalization-degradation of signaling molecules, receptor antagonists, and inhibitors such as inhibitors of activated STAT proteins (PIAS) or suppressors of cytokine signaling proteins (SOCS) [<a href="#B52" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">52</a>].</p>\n<p id="p43">Indirect examples of the implication of this pathway in wound healing are the relationship of the same with the immune system, the main actor during healing. Inhibitors of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway are currently used to treat autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis [<a href="#B53" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">53</a>].</p>\n<p id="p44">GHR is a transmembrane protein belonging to the family of receptors of class I cytokines, which homodimerizes after its binding to the ligand and signals through the family of tyrosine kinases of JAK2 and the recruitment of transcriptional factors of the STAT type, in particular isoforms 3 and 5. Intracellular signaling involves the activation by phosphorylation of different intracellular proteins, including IRS-1, MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) [<a href="#B54" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">54</a>]. Intracellular signaling induced by GH is downregulated by the family of cytokine signaling suppressors (SOCS) [<a href="#B55" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">55</a>].</p>\n<p id="p45">Different members of this pathway have been described, but their main mission is to transmit extracellular information, via specific receptors binding of the ligand and phosphorylation, to the nucleus. To describe the functioning of the latter pathway is out of the scope of this review, and we will focus on those aspects related to wound healing.</p>\n<div class="section" id="sec_2_4" data-lvl="4">\n<h4 class="heading subsection-title">2.1.1.1. Role of JAK/STAT in wound healing</h4>\n<p id="p46">Fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and macrophages, are some of the cells in which cytokines and growth factors, using the JAK/STAT pathway, play a key role during the wound repair process. Pathological conditions can affect the normal functioning of this pathway, delaying the closure of the wound, and leading to the development of a chronic wound [<a href="#B56" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">56</a>]. For example, Feng and colleagues studied the gene expression pattern of seven SOCSs members in tissue collected from chronic venous leg ulcer patients; they found significantly higher mRNA levels of SOCS3 and SOCS4&nbsp;in chronic nonhealing ulcers as compared to healing/healed ulcers [<a href="#B57" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">57</a>]. In chronic wounds, it is required that the JAK/STAT pathway be upregulated, especially in cases when its normal functioning has been compromised; more specifically in an environment of senescent cells or DM where there is a reduced growth factor/receptor signaling [<a href="#B53" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">53</a>].</p>\n<p id="p48">As known, GH is one of the growth factors using the JAK/STAT pathway as an intracellular signaling pathway for exerting its actions. In fact, the inhibition of this GH signaling by SOCS members has been defended as a key factor affecting GH effect along with vasoinhibins. Moreover, GH induces the expression of CIS and SOCS1&ndash;3, which suggests that these proteins may also play a physiological role in the regulation of GH secretion. SOCS2 seems to act downregulating GH activity [<a href="#B58" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">58</a>]. In this sense, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B or TNF&alpha;, and endotoxins, which are frequently increased in inflammatory states such as DM or in patients suffering from severe peripheral ischemia, may induce SOCS proteins which could lead to a GH insensitivity. Nevertheless, SOCS2 has been found that paradoxically may upregulate GH signaling at high concentrations in mice [<a href="#B58" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">58</a>]. Thus, both uncontrolled inflammation and infection at wounds may block the action of growth factors using this pathway, and delay the healing (<a href="#F5" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="fig">Figure&nbsp;5</a>).</p>\n<figure class="media-panel" id="F5"><div class="media"><img src="/media/chapter/64089/media/F5.png" class="figure-link" alt=""></div><figcaption class="caption"><h4>Figure&nbsp;5.</h4><p>Activation of the GHR by GH, administered subcutaneously or secreted by the pituitary gland (systemic) or locally applied on the wound (topical).

This cellular production of the hormone may lead to an interaction with the membrane GHR (8) impeding the effects of endocrine, or exogenously administered hormone, or topically applied; these auto/paracrine GHs even may produce the desensitization of GHR, therefore impeding GH actions at this level.

On the right of the figure, it can be seen that some pathological situations, such as diabetes mellitus (DM) or peripheral ischemia lead to inflammation.

SOCS have been related to inflammatory diseases, since in the absence of SOCS3, IL-6 acts decreasing tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&alpha;), by inhibiting the STAT3 signaling. It has to be highlighted that immune response, crucial in wound healing, is modulated by IL6 [<a href="#B59" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">59</a>]. SOCS4 and SOCS5 have also been linked to EGF signaling, regulating its receptor (EGFR), and affecting its signaling capacity in senescent fibroblast cells [<a href="#B53" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">53</a>].</p>\n<p id="p51">The effects of the JAK/STAT pathway seem to be time-dependent: positive and protective in early phases, while negative and inhibitory in the later chronic phase [<a href="#B60" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">60</a>].</p>\n<p id="p52">Upregulation of the STAT genes and activation of the STAT proteins have been directly linked to wound healing in intestinal epithelial cells [<a href="#B61" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">61</a>].</p>\n<p id="p53">Further investigations into cellular and molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in wound healing, and methods of activating senescent cells through various treatments will add possible benefits on this process in the future; therefore GH, the anti-aging factor for excellence, could be one of them.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="section" id="sec_5_2" data-lvl="2">\n<h3 class="heading section-title">2.2. GH, circadian rhythm disorders, and wound healing</h3>\n<p id="p54">All organisms have an adaptive mechanism, and several of their functions are synchronized to environmental factors and possess biological clocks that endogenously estimate the time. Consequently, functions such as the sleep-wake cycle and secretion of various hormones exhibit a rhythm with a characteristic period of ~24&nbsp;hours (the so-called circadian rhythms). There is a relationship between feeding, the organs involved in food intake, metabolic networks, and circadian physiology. One of the most important endocrine axes involved in circadian rhythm is the axis Ghrelin-GH-IGF-1. The coordinating role of these hormones lies in regulating appetite, behavior, growth, and cell proliferation, with a clear influence in the metabolic regulation of nutrients and all those processes dependent of them, as it is wound healing. Some hormones have been implied in the regulation of circadian GH production, as cortisol, thyrotropin (TSH), and insulin, in addition to some important neurotransmitters [<a href="#B62" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">62</a>].</p>\n<p id="p55">Although GH is mainly released by the anterior pituitary gland, there is a peripheral GH production in practically all the organism, highly dependent on developmental stages, at the level of tissues as nervous system, or the immune, cardiovascular, gonadal, and musculoskeletal system. This peripheral GH plays an autocrine and paracrine role [<a href="#B63" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">63</a>]. In humans, plasma GH shows a circadian pattern of secretion, different according to sex and age; during puberty, the hormone reaches its highest plasma values, but once puberty ends, the secretion of the hormone begins to decline until being practically undetectable in elder people [<a href="#B64" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">64</a>].</p>\n<p id="p56">The circadian pattern of GH is affected by nutritional status (caloric intake), age, stress, sex, physical exercise, and lack of sleep. Nutritional status is a key determinant in the regulation of GH secretion; thus, while fasting increases the frequency of GH secretion pulses, while IGF-1 levels decrease, in obesity the opposite occurs, at least during childhood [<a href="#B65" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">65</a>]. During fasting, GHR are downregulated [<a href="#B66" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">66</a>, <a href="#B67" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">67</a>]. Evidence for a circadian effect on the reduction of human GH gene expression has been demonstrated in response to excess caloric intake [<a href="#B68" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">68</a>], and obesity has been associated to the suppression of circulating GH [<a href="#B69" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">69</a>].</p>\n<p id="p57">The highest pulse amplitude of GH secretion is observed during the REM phase of the sleep, while sleep deprivation leads to a strong inhibition of nocturnal GH secretion [<a href="#B70" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">70</a>, <a href="#B71" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">71</a>].</p>\n<p id="p58">Several studies have shown that prolonged sleep deprivation, with the subsequent stress, leads to a reduction in body mass, elevated energy metabolism, changes in circulating hormones, and loss of immune system integrity [<a href="#B72" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">72</a>]. Stress mediators act on immune cells to modulate the production of key regulatory cytokines [<a href="#B73" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">73</a>, <a href="#B74" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">74</a>]. Thus, circadian rhythm disorders affect the levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF&alpha;, natural killer cells, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, GH, and melatonin, all of them playing a key role in wound healing [<a href="#B75" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">75</a>, <a href="#B76" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">76</a>, <a href="#B77" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">77</a>]. Melatonin has potential effects on the immune system, as inhibition of pineal melatonin synthesis with propranolol or pinealectomy results in immunosuppression and negative effects on wound healing [<a href="#B78" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">78</a>]. Yet another study found that melatonin improved wound healing when given at night, coinciding with its normal circadian period of secretion [<a href="#B79" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">79</a>].</p>\n<p id="p59">Notwithstanding all these data, some studies disagree with the concept that sleep exerts a predominant influence on GH release and its effects whatever the conditions be, as it seems to occur compensatory mechanisms promoting GH pulses during wakefulness [<a href="#B80" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">80</a>].</p>\n<p id="p60">Thus, GH influences on wound healing progression. Physiologic circadian rhythm, with higher levels of the hormone during the night, will make a faster healing of wounds during the night, and the alteration of this pattern by different factors might exert a deleterious effect on wound healing via GH and others hormones related to it, although compensatory mechanisms have been described in the long-term.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="section" id="sec_7" data-lvl="1">\n<h2 class="heading main-title">3. IGF-1 and wound healing</h2>\n<p id="p61">IGF-1 is considered as the main mediator of GH actions, and it has been considered as the &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; GH, at least for growing, although GH exerts many actions directly without the participation of IGF-1 [<a href="#B27" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">27</a>].</p>\n<p id="p62">IGF-1 is a polypeptide structural and functionally similar to insulin. It is produced in the liver and practically all extrahepatic tissues, and its production depends not only of GH, but also is strongly influenced by the nutritional status of the organism, at least in the liver. The local production of IGF-1 has been shown to regulate many physiological and pathophysiological states such as fetal development, atherosclerosis, and tissue repair. During tissue repair, IGF-1 is secreted by platelets, macrophages, and fibroblasts of the wound [<a href="#B5" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">5</a>].</p>\n<p id="p63">In wounds, IGF-1 increases protein production and cell proliferation and migration, which are crucial in the healing process [<a href="#B81" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">81</a>, <a href="#B82" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">82</a>]. IGF-1 expression is enhanced in subcutaneous [<a href="#B5" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">5</a>], and incisional [<a href="#B83" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">83</a>] wounds, and in postburn injuries [<a href="#B84" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">84</a>]. Some studies have shown that the administration of exogenous IGF-I enhanced protein synthesis in severely burned experimental animals [<a href="#B85" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">85</a>].</p>\n<p id="p64">Moreover, the levels of this growth factor are reduced in the wound environment of diabetic patients. Wound-related parameters as proteins, DNA, hydroxyproline, and macrophages have been shown to be decreased as a consequence of diabetes. After 14&nbsp;days of treatment with IGF-1&nbsp;in rats with diabetes produced by streptozotocin, it was observed that the total values of hydroxyproline, DNA, proteins, and macrophages increased by 48, 52, 31, and 40%, respectively [<a href="#B5" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">5</a>]. These data support the fact that the suppression of IGF-1 and the macrophage function impairment within the wound environment by the diabetic state are responsible, at least in part, for the delay of wound healing in this disease.</p>\n<p id="p65">In this context, the relationship between the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the estrogen receptor (ER) is of interest. Locally administered IGF-1 promotes wound repair in an estrogen-deprived animal model, the ovariectomized (Ovx) mouse, mainly by dampening the local inflammatory response and promoting re-epithelialization. Using specific IGF-1R and ER antagonists it has been shown how IGF-1-mediated effects on re-epithelialization were directly mediated by IGF-1R [<a href="#B86" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">86</a>]. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory effects of IGF-1 were predominantly mediated by ERs, in particular ERa (<a href="#F6" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="fig">Figure&nbsp;6</a>). When ERa-null mice were used, IGF-1 could not promote healing and local inflammation increased [<a href="#B86" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">86</a>]. These findings illustrate the great complexity of interactions between growth factors at the cutaneous level.</p>\n<figure class="media-panel" id="F6"><div class="media"><img src="/media/chapter/64089/media/F6.png" class="figure-link" alt=""></div><figcaption class="caption"><h4>Figure&nbsp;6.</h4><p>Local expression of IGF-1&nbsp;in a wound. This expression may be induced by GH, but also IG-1 may proceed from platelets, macrophages, and fibroblasts. Local IGF-1 induces protein synthesis and cell proliferation by interacting with its receptor IGF-1R, and also has anti-inflammatory effects, although in this case IGF-1 seems to act via the estrogen receptor a (ERa).</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p id="p67">Recent data on the systemic administration of IGF-1 have shown an apparent lack of effect in wound healing. Therefore, perhaps only the IGF-1 produced locally by fibroblasts and macrophages contributes to the regulation of wound healing [<a href="#B46" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">46</a>, <a href="#B47" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">47</a>], although it is also possible that the dose used and the type of administration do not have been the most appropriate in this case. If the systemic IGF-1 is ineffective in wound healing, topical administration of IGF-1 could be considered, as other growth factors such as EGF, TGF&beta;, or the own GH.&nbsp;In addition, IGF-1 systemic administration produces mild complications as hypoglycemia and hypotension. These limit its clinical usefulness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="section" id="sec_8" data-lvl="1">\n<h2 class="heading main-title">4. Analogs of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and wound healing</h2>\n<p id="p68">The complexity of GH regulation seems to be related to the multiple roles that GH plays in the human body, very far than those classically thought [<a href="#B27" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">27</a>]. Interestingly, some of these roles are played in conjunction with GH-stimulating factors.</p>\n<p id="p69">As described, growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is an important neuroendocrine peptide secreted by the hypothalamus, regulating the synthesis and release of GH [<a href="#B87" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">87</a>]. Classically, it was thought that the role of GHRH simply was the regulation of the synthesis and secretion of GH [<a href="#B88" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">88</a>, <a href="#B89" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">89</a>]. However, the detection of GHRH and its receptors, as well as the expression of GHRH gene in several extra-hypothalamic tissues, including placenta, ovary, testis, digestive tract, and tumors [<a href="#B90" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">90</a>, <a href="#B91" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">91</a>], suggests that GHRH plays a wider role than simply acting on the regulation of pituitary GH secretion; in fact, it seems to be particularly involved in conditions aimed at tissue regeneration and repair. The presence of the peptide in peripheral tissues highlights the possibility that locally produced GHRH might act as an autocrine growth factor playing a role in cell proliferation. In addition to its own actions in various tissues, several GHRH agonists have been developed showing that the effects of this neuropeptide could include direct actions on wound healing. For example, a pioneer work demonstrated that the GHRH agonist JI-38 stimulates the proliferation and migration of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) [<a href="#B92" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">92</a>]. The upregulation of GHRH receptor (GHRH-R) and its splicing variant 1 (SV1) in GHRH-R negative 3T3 fibroblasts has been shown to promote its proliferation when GHRH and its analogs are given [<a href="#B93" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">93</a>, <a href="#B94" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">94</a>]. Despite it is logical to think that fibroblast stimulation by GHRH agonist could be mediated by GH/IGF-1. Some authors have found that using MR-409 and MR-502 GHRH agonists, there was a promotion of wound healing by stimulating the proliferation and survival of dermal fibroblast through phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways, although neither GH nor IGF-1 was found to be significantly increased in fibroblasts after 4&nbsp;hours exposure to these agonists. Moreover, none of the agonists showed an effect on the expression levels of either IGF-1 receptor (IGF1-R) or its phosphorylated isoform. Thus, these findings imply direct effects of GHRH and its agonists on extra-pituitary cells and tissues [<a href="#B95" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">95</a>].</p>\n<p id="p70">GHRH affects the proliferation of fibroblasts as well as their migration and the expression of smooth muscle actin &alpha; (&alpha;-SMA) [<a href="#B92" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">92</a>], which is organized into stress fibers and exerts contractile forces on the extracellular matrix [<a href="#B96" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">96</a>]. Therefore, it seems that GHRH can regulate, simultaneously, both the kinetic profile and the differentiation of fibroblasts in myofibroblasts (<a href="#F7" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="fig">Figure&nbsp;7</a>).</p>\n<figure class="media-panel" id="F7"><div class="media"><img src="/media/chapter/64089/media/F7.png" class="figure-link" alt=""></div><figcaption class="caption"><h4>Figure&nbsp;7.</h4><p>Possible effects of GHRH on wound healing. The possibility exists that GHRH is expressed in cells in a wound, since its short life in plasma does not explain its effects on wound healing. However, GHRH agonists do not suffer proteolytic degradation; therefore, they may mimic the effects of GHRH on the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts and its differentiation in myofibroblasts, as well as inducing the expression of smooth muscle a-actin which favors the appearance of contractile forces on the extracellular matrix (ECM). Blue arrows: induction or activation; red arrow: inhibition.</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p id="p72">The suppression of growth of fibroblasts in not healing-wound environment is partially due to the decreased sensitivity of resident cells and rapid degradation of growth factors used in different therapies by proteases released from inflammatory cells and bacteria [<a href="#B97" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">97</a>, <a href="#B98" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">98</a>]. Therefore, it would be necessary to have a factor that exerted a strong mitogen action on the fibroblasts, while being resistant to proteolytic degradation. In this sense, unlike the natural GHRH [<a href="#B95" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">95</a>], the above mentioned MR agonists seem to have an increased resistance to degradation by proteases, because many of the coded amino acids in the peptide chain have been replaced with synthetic non-natural and/or non-coded amino acids which are much less susceptible to such degradation [<a href="#B99" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">99</a>]. Consequently, these analogs have demonstrated a greatly prolonged half-life in&nbsp;vivo, making them promising agents for use in wound healing, where an environment rich in proteases is often found. Even more, it was found that MR class agonists do not stimulate tumor growth or neoplastic transformation [<a href="#B95" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">95</a>].</p>\n<p id="p73">Another factor supporting the use of GHRH agonists has been found in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC), that seems to express both pituitary GHRH-R and its splicing variant 1 (SV1). HDMEC is responsible for angiogenesis, a critical event for granulation tissue formation [<a href="#B95" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">95</a>].</p>\n<p id="p74">The endogenous GHRH produced by fibroblasts regulates its own activity, and the role that GHRH signaling may play in physiological maintenance of wound healing could improve with some GHRH agonists.</p>\n<p id="p75">The high concentration of glucose in diabetic patients inhibits the proliferation of fibroblasts and favors resistance to growth factors, decreasing wound healing. Interestingly, MR-409 enhances the survival of transplanted pancreatic islets and helps to lower blood glucose in diabetic SCID mice [<a href="#B100" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">100</a>]; therefore, it would be interesting to investigate whether it might benefit diabetic wounds which are hard to cure, partially because of the special adverse bacterial environment. However, some other aspects of diabetic injuries should also be addressed; such is the case of the affectation of the neuropathic response, the true conductor in this process.</p>\n<p id="p76">Despite these data, the precise physiologic and biochemical mechanism for GHRH accelerating wound healing remains unclear. Besides, the production of GHRH in dermal wounds still seems not to be clear. Moreover, given its short lifetime, it is unlikely that plasma GHRH may reach adequate levels to contribute to wound healing. A possibility, not explored, is that some GHRH agonists produced in dermal wounds during healing might be responsible for the activity of GHRH on wound healing.</p>\n<p id="p77">Whether this apparently novel function of GHRH is operational in a different kind of healing or it is indicative of the activity of a structurally related peptide(s), should be investigated more extensively to elucidate some of the basic aspects of skin biology and repair, as well as in view of its potential implications in therapeutic wound healing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="section" id="sec_9" data-lvl="1">\n<h2 class="heading main-title">5. Wound healing in catabolic states: the role of growth hormone</h2>\n<p id="p78">The balance between anabolic and catabolic states and hormones may affect wound healing, since the overall protein compartment status has a great influence on this process [<a href="#B101" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">101</a>]. Protein synthesis restores and maintains lean body mass, composed of muscle, skin, and the immune system, all of them having a role during wound repair. When anabolic activity decreases, as occurs during stress, aging, or chronic disease, there is a derivation of proteins to the energy compartment and, therefore, affects wound healing as a result of protein depletion in the wound to restore lost lean mass. Impaired immunity and healing during catabolic states are directly proportional to the degree of lean mass loss [<a href="#B102" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">102</a>, <a href="#B103" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">103</a>]. Protein depletion appears to delay wound healing by prolonging the inflammatory phase (inhibits fibroplasia, synthesis of collagen, and proteoglycans), affects the proliferation phase (neoangiogenesis) and inhibits wound remodeling [<a href="#B104" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">104</a>]. It has been shown that protein depletion models produce a decrease in tensile strength of wounds in animals, and rats fed with a protein-deficient diet showed a decrease in wound integrity and resistance as compared to control animals [<a href="#B105" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">105</a>].</p>\n<p id="p79">Burn injury induces acute and severe inflammation and a hypermetabolic state which are strongly correlated to the size of the burn [<a href="#B106" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">106</a>]. The inflammatory process reaches a peak during the first week postburn and persists to a lesser extent throughout convalescence [<a href="#B107" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">107</a>]. The hypermetabolic state begins 5&nbsp;days after the burn, and may last up to 1&nbsp;year after the injury, with energy requirements that reach 150&ndash;200% of the basal metabolic rate [<a href="#B108" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">108</a>].</p>\n<p id="p80">GH is one of the most important anabolic hormones and, like other anabolic hormones, has an anti-cortisol activity, lowering the catabolic response of this steroid, without altering its protective anti-inflammatory activity. Many studies have demonstrated the usefulness of anabolic hormones in existing wounds in catabolic states. However, it remains difficult to determine whether the benefit is due to the increase in the systemic anabolic state or to a direct effect on the anabolic state of the wound [<a href="#B109" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">109</a>].</p>\n<p id="p81">Starvation and intense exercise, both being catabolic states, are potent stimuli of GH, while acute or chronic injury or illness inhibits GH release, especially in the elderly [<a href="#B109" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">109</a>]. GH leads to an increased influx of amino acids into the cell, decreasing the flow of these from the same. The increase in fatty metabolism that GH produces is also beneficial, since it preserves the amino acids for the synthesis of proteins, instead of being used as an energy resource.</p>\n<p id="p82">Severe burns and injuries, people with HIV infection with wasting and elderly people, all of them catabolic states, are populations that could benefit from GH therapy. GH increases lean mass, muscle strength, and immune function in these states, but requires an intake of a high-protein, high-energy diet [<a href="#B109" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">109</a>].</p>\n<p id="p83">The skin is a target tissue for GH, and GHRs have been found on the surface of epidermal cells. Recent data indicate that IGF-1 and insulin also provide some of the anabolic effects of GH therapy in wounds [<a href="#B110" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">110</a>, <a href="#B111" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">111</a>]. GH administered exogenously increases the thickness of the skin even in normal people [<a href="#B112" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">112</a>]. It has been shown that GH can improve the re-epithelialization rate of sites where a skin graft has taken place in adults and children with severe burns or trauma [<a href="#B7" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">7</a>, <a href="#B10" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">10</a>]. In addition, it has been seen, in experimental models, that GH also accelerates the healing by increasing wound collagen content, granulation tissue, and wound tensile strength, as well as the local production of IGF-1 by fibroblasts [<a href="#B109" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">109</a>, <a href="#B113" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">113</a>].</p>\n<p id="p84">A study conducted on burned children also supports the role of GH in catabolic states, since no differences were found in mortality, organ failure, or clinically significant morbidity between the groups, and the requirements for albumin supplementation were reduced by 65%, as well as episodes of hypocalcemia, an unexpected benefit of the hormone [<a href="#B114" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">114</a>]. As it will be discussed at the end of the chapter, unlike it happens in children, it has been reported an increase of mortality in adult with burns when GH was used [<a href="#B115" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">115</a>]. However, the authors of the study in pediatric population have been treating severely burned children with rhGH for more than 10&nbsp;years, and they have reported that 0.2&nbsp;mg/kg/day of rhGH in this catabolic state has some benefits, accelerating donor site wound healing by up to 30% and reducing a 25% the hospital stay and costs. They have also shown that GH increased protein synthesis by more than 25%. Another study has also found that GH causes significant serum elevations in other different parameters as total catecholamines, insulin, glucagon, or free fatty acids. GH therapy even showed a rise in blood flow of the leg [<a href="#B114" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">114</a>].</p>\n<p id="p85">In summary, the use of GH together with adequate nutrition and protein intake, at the appropriate doses, clearly improves anabolic activity and, as a consequence, positively impacts wound healing, even in patients with spinal cord injuries, as <a href="#F8" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="fig">Figure&nbsp;8</a> shows. Although many data suggest that the effect of GH on wound healing can be direct, it is still unknown whether some other hormones could contribute to this positive effect.</p>\n<figure class="media-panel" id="F8"><div class="media"><img src="/media/chapter/64089/media/F8.png" class="figure-link" alt=""></div><figcaption class="caption"><h4>Figure&nbsp;8.</h4><p>Evolution of a pressure ulcer in the foot of a quadriplegic patient (complete spinal cord injury, C5-C6) treated with GH applied topically (0.4&nbsp;mg/day, 5&nbsp;days/week), before the treatment (10/10/2012) and throughout it until the healing of the wound (02/27/2013).</p></figcaption></figure>\n<div class="section" id="sec_9_2" data-lvl="2">\n<h3 class="heading section-title">5.1. Ghrelin, GH, and wound healing</h3>\n<p id="p87">Ghrelin (GH-releasing peptide or GHRP) is a small peptide found in the gastrointestinal tract in 1999 [<a href="#B116" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">116</a>]. Although it is mainly secreted by the stomach, it is known that Ghrelin is also produced in other territories, such as the intestine or placenta, for example.</p>\n<p id="p88">In addition to its known actions on the regulation of appetite and energy expenditure, it has also been discovered that this hormone plays a role in the control of inflammation and metabolism, as do leptin and adiponectin. In fact, all three hormones are interrelated in chronic disease states [<a href="#B117" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">117</a>, <a href="#B118" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">118</a>, <a href="#B119" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">119</a>]. Interestingly, in a study that addressed the relationship between these hormones in burns, the authors came to the surprising conclusion that they acted in two different ways: one in normal physiological conditions or chronic disease states, and another after severe acute stresses such as burn injury [<a href="#B120" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">120</a>]. This can be an adaptive mechanism that depends on the physiological situation or the type of the pathological condition.</p>\n<p id="p89">Recently, it was demonstrated that Ghrelin improves hemodynamic and metabolic alterations and attenuates cancer, heart affectations, and cachexia induced by burns, and also again protects the damage induced by burns and facilitates the healing of wounds [<a href="#B121" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">121</a>].</p>\n<p id="p90">In relation to the hemodynamic role of this hormone, receptors for Ghrelin have been found in the aorta, the left cardiac ventricle, and the left cardiac atrium in rats. In healthy humans, the intravenous infusion of Ghrelin decreases blood pressure, increases the cardiac index, and produces a greater volume of the pulse [<a href="#B122" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">122</a>].</p>\n<p id="p91">Ghrelin also has an anti-inflammatory effect, by inhibiting the secretion of IL-6 and TNF&alpha; from monocytes and T5 cells [<a href="#B119" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">119</a>, <a href="#B123" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">123</a>]. The protective role of Ghrelin appears to depend on the integrity of GH/IGF-1 axis, since in studies of inflammation with pancreatitis, protection against inflammation did not occur in hypophysectomized rats unless they received IGF-1&nbsp;in parallel with Ghrelin. In these studies, when normal GH secretion was reached, the inflammation was reduced in severity, with a more rapid regeneration of the pancreas, resulting in a reduction in the serum concentrations of interleukin 1-&beta; pro-inflammatory (IL-1&beta;) as well as the amylase and lipase activities. In addition, there was an increase in pancreatic blood flow, and DNA synthesis increased in this organ. This demonstrates that the possible role of Ghrelin during catabolic states needs an adequate functioning of the GH/IGF-1 axis [<a href="#B124" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">124</a>]. This last statement has also been supported by models of colitis in which treatment with Ghrelin clearly improved the area of damage in the colonic mucosa in intact pituitary rats, but increased it in hypophysectomized animals. In addition, it was shown that rats with a normal production of GH-IGF-1 had improved blood flow in the colonic mucosa and increased mucosal cell proliferation while treated with Ghrelin, as well as reduced levels of IL1-1&beta; and myeloperoxidase; just the opposite of what was found in hypophysectomized rats [<a href="#B125" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">125</a>].</p>\n<p id="p92">The therapeutic effect of Ghrelin on wound healing has also been evaluated using a rat model in which the administration of radiation was combined with the induction of a wound. The altered healing of a wound caused by radiation often occurs in clinical practice and the exact mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet clear. In this wound model, the administration of Ghrelin promoted the healing of skin wounds, and also reduced the average time of wound closure [<a href="#B126" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">126</a>]. Ghrelin inhibited the induction of serum pro-inflammatory mediators, especially TNF&alpha;, and promoted wound healing in a dose-dependent manner [<a href="#B127" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">127</a>]. After the isolation and analysis of the granulation tissues, a greater synthesis of DNA, hexosamine, nitrate, and nitrite, a high content of collagen and an enhanced neovascularization was observed after treatment with Ghrelin. The hormone also increased the expression of VEGF and TGF&beta;, responsible for wound healing as described. Again, when a GH 1a secretagogue receptor blocker (GHS-R1a) was administered, all of these therapeutic effects of Ghrelin were affected [<a href="#B126" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">126</a>]. These results identify Ghrelin as a peptide that could be used for the affected wound healing induced by radiation, although it is necessary that there is a normal secretion of GH so that its effects occur. These effects of Ghrelin are shown in <a href="#F9" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="fig">Figure&nbsp;9</a>.</p>\n<figure class="media-panel" id="F9"><div class="media"><img src="/media/chapter/64089/media/F9.png" class="figure-link" alt=""></div><figcaption class="caption"><h4>Figure&nbsp;9.</h4><p>Ghrelin effects on a wound. While many positive effects appear at very different levels during wound healing, there is a need for a normal pituitary secretion of GH, so that these Ghrelin effects can occur. Therefore, it is not clear whether these effects depend on Ghrelin or on GH, although the possibility exists that GH could induce Ghrelin expression in the wound.</p></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n<div class="section" id="sec_10_2" data-lvl="2">\n<h3 class="heading section-title">5.2. Cellular senescence and wound healing: benefit of GH therapy</h3>\n<p id="p94">Cellular senescence is the consequence of DNA damage secondary to oxidative stress associated with aging or chronic morbid conditions such as diabetes. This seems to be an antitumor mechanism [<a href="#B128" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">128</a>]. The number of senescent cells is low in young individuals, while it increases with age in all tissues, including the skin [<a href="#B129" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">129</a>, <a href="#B130" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">130</a>].</p>\n<p id="p95">At skin level, senescence has been reported in keratinocytes, melanocytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, T-lymphocytes, and even in stem cells [<a href="#B131" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">131</a>, <a href="#B132" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">132</a>, <a href="#B133" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">133</a>].</p>\n<p id="p96">This concept has emerged as a possible cause of general tissue dysfunction [<a href="#B134" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">134</a>, <a href="#B135" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">135</a>], since, although senescent cells are unable to divide, they remain metabolically active. This high metabolic activity is associated with the release of a multitude of cytokines, chemokines, and pro-inflammatory growth factors, which leads to its denomination as the secretion phenotype associated with senescence (SASP) [<a href="#B136" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">136</a>]. These factors would include interleukin (IL) 6 and IL-8, chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCPs), macrophage inflammatory proteins, and growth factors as VEGF, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), TGF&beta;, and proteinases such as matrix metalloproteinases [<a href="#B128" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">128</a>, <a href="#B137" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">137</a>]. All these factors can act in an autocrine and paracrine way, also having effects on the surrounding cells and their environment. Therefore, the senescent cell itself could initiate a feedback mechanism by spreading this phenomenon to nearby cells [<a href="#B138" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">138</a>].</p>\n<p id="p97">Characteristically, the inflammation resulting from cellular senescence is sterile or is not associated with pathogens [<a href="#B137" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">137</a>]. It has been suggested that chronic low-level inflammation that is often observed during aging in tissues without obvious infection is due to senescent cells and SASP [<a href="#B139" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">139</a>]. In addition, a low number of senescent cells can have systemic effects, and it is already evident that the senescence process can be transmitted to normal cells by SASP in a paracrine or autocrine manner [<a href="#B128" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">128</a>].</p>\n<p id="p98">The basis of this senescence is mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn causes oxidative stress, which has been implicated as a cause of aging [<a href="#B140" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">140</a>].</p>\n<p id="p99">Understanding this process would help develop different strategies that could mitigate chronic inflammation and, therefore, cellular senescence. These dysfunctional and destructive signs are also found in the wounds of diabetic or elderly patients, altering the normal healing process.</p>\n<p id="p100">At this point, it is important to note that GH is a mitochondrial protector [<a href="#B141" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">141</a>, <a href="#B142" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">142</a>, <a href="#B143" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">143</a>], therefore, playing a positive role in this process. GH restores the redox imbalance, improving the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the production of energy.</p>\n<p id="p101">In situations of GH deficiency (GHD) there is an accelerated aging process. In mice with GHD, GH replacement therapy increases stress resistance by altering the functional capacity of the glutathione S-transferase system (GST) through the regulation of specific members of the GST family [<a href="#B144" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">144</a>]. The hormone also affects the regulation of thioredoxins (TRX) and glutaredoxins (GRX), which are factors that regulate the post-translational modification of proteins and the redox balance, also influencing resistance to stress [<a href="#B144" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">144</a>]. Patients with GHD show a decrease in their life expectancy with a twice higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease. In this regard, after 24&nbsp;weeks of GH replacement therapy in the GREAT study, the hormone significantly lowered plasma diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites and improved endothelial function, as measured by reactive hyperemia index [<a href="#B145" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">145</a>]. This indicates that GH can exert a protective role in redox balance in GHD, in which predominates a pro-oxidant environment, corrected by short-term GH administration [<a href="#B146" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">146</a>]. Klotho, a GH-releasing factor that currently is gaining in interest, also lowers the oxidative stress, decreasing apoptosis and senescence of the vascular system in an atherogenic risk rat model [<a href="#B147" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">147</a>]. The hormone also affects the regulation of TRX and GRX, which are factors that regulate the post-translational modification of proteins and the redox balance, also influencing resistance to stress [<a href="#B41" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">41</a>]. As a consequence of the antioxidant action of GH, the hormone produces a benefit in the inflammatory state associated with senescence [<a href="#B22" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">22</a>]. It has been reported that this protection against oxidative stress is mediated by GH induction of the RAS/ERK pathways [<a href="#B148" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">148</a>].</p>\n<p id="p102">However, the exact role of GH in the redox equilibrium has not been fully understood, since in some cases of oxidative stress, overproduction, or administration of GH in excess may enhance oxidation [<a href="#B149" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">149</a>]. Thus, both the overproduction of GH and its deficiency are closely related to increased oxidative stress.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="section" id="sec_11_2" data-lvl="2">\n<h3 class="heading section-title">5.3. Contrary studies not supporting a GH role in wound healing</h3>\n<p id="p103">As described in the introduction, GH needs specific stimuli to exert its effects. In fact, there is a study carried out to determine the effect of rhGH on the rate of wound healing in normal individuals. In each subject was performed a split-thickness wound in one buttock and a full-thickness wound in the other. The full-thickness wound healed significantly more slowly in the group treated with rhGH compared to the control group treated with placebo, while no statistically significant difference was observed in the healing of the split-thickness wounds. This study concluded that rhGH may delay healing in normal patients with full-thickness wounds, although it could not be ruled out if the healing delay associated to rhGH group was due to the quality of the scab, thereby, appearing only as an alteration of the wound healing process [<a href="#B18" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">18</a>].</p>\n<p id="p104">In another trial, the serum levels of some hormones, GH, insulin, and cortisol were analyzed in normal and diabetic rats during wound healing. It was shown that the rate of wound healing in normal rats is faster than that of diabetics. The serum insulin concentrations were lower in the diabetic rats compared to the normal and control groups and showed a correlation with the wound healing process in diabetic rats. Serum cortisol concentrations decreased in the normal and diabetic groups during wound healing, but did not show a significant correlation with this process. Serum GH levels did not change significantly in any of the groups, nor did they show a significant correlation with the wound healing process [<a href="#B150" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">150</a>]. As described above, a possible explanation for these findings is that the main effect of GH in this case could occur as a consequence of the local production of the hormone, something that was overlooked because it was not measured. A small wound on the back of the animal is not a stimulus strong enough to increase systemic GH, which seems to be related, as demonstrated, to more intense catabolic states.</p>\n<p id="p105">A recent report from two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trials conducted in Europe, which studied the effects of rhGH in critically ill burned adult patients, in an intensive care unit, revealed a significant increase in mortality among catabolic patients treated with rhGH (42 vs. 18%) [<a href="#B115" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">115</a>]. GH, in fact, can increase cell adhesion molecules (CAM), since the serum of healthy patients treated with GH significantly increased the expression of VCAM-1&nbsp;in cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells [<a href="#B151" class="ref-link" data-ref-style="bibr">151</a>], and this could be the mechanism involved, but it must be taken into account that in these studies high doses of GH were used (10&ndash;20 times greater than the usual treatment dose), which would facilitate the appearance of side effects produced by the hormone. In contrast to these data, when the same study was carried out in burned children, no differences were found in mortality, but other beneficial effects were found.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="section" id="sec_13" data-lvl="1">\n<h2 class="heading main-title">6. Conclusion</h2>\n<p id="p106">Despite all data here presented, it is necessary to remember that the patient with a problem in the wound healing needs to be addressed in a holistic way. That is, &ldquo;we do not treat a hole in the patient, but the whole patient&rdquo;. Normal wounds in healthy people are not a problem. However, a delaying wound always appears in a patient with a morbid condition, normally in an elderly patient or that with a catabolic state or a chronic disease as diabetes mellitus. Therefore, using only a topical wound treatment seems to be an unrealistic approach to healing. However, a total approach will be more beneficial to not only accelerate the healing process but also decrease the possibility of a new wound.</p>\n<p id="p107">The knowledge of the molecular aspects related to wound repair and tissue regeneration, as well as the whole circumstances affecting also the patients is crucial to success dealing with this topic.</p>\n<p id="p108">We cannot overlook the high amount of data regarding the role of GH and its secretagogues, not only in the healing process, but also improving the pro-oxidant state of the patients. GH therapy is a cheap and well known drug, and may increase many growth factors when is locally used in wounds. Maybe the combination of appropriate doses of systemic GH and topical application in the wound would be a good option. The combination of GH or its secretagogues and IGF-1&nbsp;in a topical way, could be also a beneficious approach for wounds repair.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="section" id="sec_14" data-lvl="1"><h2 class="heading main-title">Acknowledgments</h2>\n<p id="p109">This chapter has been funded by the Carlos III Health Institute and the European Regional Development Fund (ISCIII-FEDER), Madrid, Spain, (grant number PI 13-00790).

Current strategies are understood best with a review of the historical development of catheter materials, solution packaging, and simplified machinery, which allow safe and effective nocturnal treatments. Quantitation of the efficacy of peritoneal dialysis is also reviewed because such calculations were also developed by the pioneers of nephrology to ensure adequacy of dialysis and daily fluid balance, which are responsible for the best chance for long-term patient survival. Comparison of methods for catheter placement is presented as well as the role that a dialysis center plays in the health and success of this form of end-stage renal disease patient care. The novel concept of assisted peritoneal dialysis for the infirm or institutionalized patients is probably the next direction needed to make available this treatment to many more patients than are currently eligible to receive it. This concept is explored in a separate chapter. Finally, professional dialysis staff must monthly assess individuals' nutritional status, bone health, and infection prevention and treatment to ensure the greatest functional status for these patients. This book concludes with a review of each of these topics to expand the mandatory monthly surveillance performed by dialysis centers for each patient who receives home peritoneal dialysis therapy.",editors:[{id:"16344",title:"Dr.",name:"Edward T.",surname:"Zawada Jr.",slug:"edward-t.-zawada-jr.",fullName:"Edward T.

Original work proved the importance of this axis on bone and skeletal homeostasis. Subsequent knowledge of basic cellular physiology led to studies of the role of vitamin D in other tissues where calcium flux is important to cellular functions. This was the beginning of exploration of vitamin D in extraskeletal health. Next came investigations into extraskeletal diseases which appeared to be more prevalent in vitamin D-deficient individuals. It was surprising that not only was there higher mortality from those diseases associated with low vitamin D levels, but also all-cause mortality was higher as well. Cellular pathophysiology of these findings was explored. Finally, studies have focused on outcomes in seriously ill patients with those diseases when hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). Inverse correlations have been seen of several common ICU outcomes with levels of vitamin D at entry to the ICU, but the current effort is now in clarifying a role for routine measurement of these levels and the possible role of at least vitamin D replacement or even supplementation in the ICU patient with multiple organ pharmacologic or mechanical life support.",signatures:"Edward T.

Therefore, vitamin K2 affects a multitude of organ systems, and it is reckoned to be one positive factor in bringing about &quot;longevity&quot; to the human body, e.g., supporting the functions/health of different organ systems, as well as correcting the functioning or even &quot;curing&quot; ailments striking several organs in our body.</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 1&nbsp; <a href="https://cdn.intechopen.com/public/docs/kappa/1_Introductory%20Chapter_Vitamin%20K2.pdf">Introductory Chapter: Vitamin K2 </a>by Jan Oxholm Gordeladze</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 2 &nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.intechopen.com/public/docs/kappa/2_VitaminK_SXR_and%20GGCX.pdf">Vitamin K, SXR, and GGCX</a> by Kotaro Azuma and Satoshi Inoue</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 3 &nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.intechopen.com/public/docs/kappa/3_Vitamin%20K2%20Rich%20Food%20Products.pdf">Vitamin K2 Rich Food Products</a> by Muhammad Yasin, Masood Sadiq Butt and Aurang Zeb</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 4 &nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.intechopen.com/public/docs/kappa/4_Menaquinones_Bacteria%20and%20Foods_Vitamin%20K2%20in%20the%20Diet.pdf">Menaquinones, Bacteria, and Foods: Vitamin K2 in the Diet </a>by Barbara Walther and Magali Chollet</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 5 &nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.intechopen.com/public/docs/kappa/5_The%20Impact%20of%20Vitamin%20K2%20on%20Energy%20Metabolism.pdf">The Impact of Vitamin K2 on Energy Metabolism</a> by Mona M&oslash;ller, Serena Tonstad, Tone Bathen and Jan Oxholm Gordeladze</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 6 &nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.intechopen.com/public/docs/kappa/6_Vitamin%20K2%20and%20Bone%20Health.pdf">Vitamin K2 and Bone Health</a> by Niels Erik Frandsen and Jan Oxholm Gordeladze</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 7 &nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.intechopen.com/public/docs/kappa/7_Vitamin%20K2%20and%20its%20Impact%20on%20Tooth%20Epigenetics.pdf">Vitamin K2 and its Impact on Tooth Epigenetics</a> by Jan Oxholm Gordeladze, Maria A.
