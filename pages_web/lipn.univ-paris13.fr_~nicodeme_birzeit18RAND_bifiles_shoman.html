We will study a special case in the decision model
introduced by Dr. Mousa et. al by considering one type of homogeneous
individuals who have uncertainly in their decision. The model has
model two possible decisions that individuals can make. The
individuals’ decisions are made according to individuals’
preferences. The preferences have the interesting feature of taking
into account not only how much an individuals like or dislike a
certain decision but also the other individuals' decisions. In this
paper we characterize the space of all parameters in which the Nash
equilibria are either pure (cohesive or disparate) or mixed. This
decision model has wide applications in real life and can be used to
understand better the social interaction, tourism, industry and
economical and political revolutions.
