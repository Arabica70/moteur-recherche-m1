<li>
This talk explores determinants of academic performance among
university students in Birzeit University.  A stratified random sample
of 400 undergraduate students in Birzeit University will be surveyed
using a self-administered questionnaire; the survey will be conducted
in the spring semester 2018.  Both factors analysis and generalized
linear regression model will be used, variables like gender, entrance
test (General High School Test), psychological well-being, classes
attendance, and other factors will be tested to determine their effect
on academic performance.  This is the first study of this type
conducted in Birzeit University. Therefore, the results contribute to
the research literature on students well-being and academic
performance through increased understanding of the determinants of
both response variables.  University administration, academic
advisors, counselors, and community health professionals will be
better equipped to design interventions aiming at improving students
academic performance and enhancing their social well-being.
