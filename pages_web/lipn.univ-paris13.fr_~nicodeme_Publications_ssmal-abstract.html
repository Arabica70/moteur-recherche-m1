<B>SSMAL: similarity searching with alignment graphs</B>

We want to provide biologists with a fast and sensitive scanning tool for
searching local alignments of  a protein query sequence
against  databases of protein multiple alignments
 such as ProDom. Reversely, we want to provide
 a tool for locally aligning  a protein 
multiple alignment query against  a protein database such as SWISSPROT.
We developed the program SSMAL (Shuffling Similarities with Multiple Alignments)
that utilizes features of the Blast (<CITE>Altschul et al. 1990</CITE>)
 algorithm and part of the Blast code.
Our software allows both scanning multiple alignments and searching
with a multiple alignment. Deletions in the multiple alignment only are handled and a SSMAL
search may miss some similarities found by a profile search. However
a SSMAL scan of a database as ProDom would be 20 to 30 times faster
that a profile scan.
 In the
worst case a SSMAL search is about 9 times faster that a profile search.
