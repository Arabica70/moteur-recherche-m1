We analyze and give details of the paper of Arek Goetz,
          where we begin with a systematic study of Euclidean
          piecewise isometric dynamical systems (p.i.d.s.) with a
          particular focus on the interplay between geometry, symbolic
          dynamics, and the group of isometries associated with
          p.i.d.s. We investigate various aspects of the dynamical
          information contained in the coding: symbolic growth and the
          periodic behavior of codings and cells. This theoretical
          investigation is motivated by the many examples of piecewise
          isometric dynamical systems found recently in the
          literature. Piecewise isometric dynamical systems are direct
          generalizations of interval exchange transformations to
          non-invertible, higher dimensional maps.
