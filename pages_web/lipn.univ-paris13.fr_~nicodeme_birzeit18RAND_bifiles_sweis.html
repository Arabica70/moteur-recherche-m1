<li>
The local fractional integral equations are one of the applications on local fractional calculus, this work study the local fractional fredholm integral equation of the second kind with separable kernel, thats mean the kernel k(x,t) can be expressed as a sum of finite numbers of terms each of which is a product of a function of x only and a function of t only, then we solve this equation by following a certain procedure to obtain a system of linear equations that can be used to solve the local fractional fredholm integral equation, also the work displays examples that show the effectiveness of this method. Keywords: local fractional calculus, local fractional fredholm integral equation, separable kernel
