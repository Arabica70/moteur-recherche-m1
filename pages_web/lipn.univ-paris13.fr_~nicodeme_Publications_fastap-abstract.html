We  present in this article a fast approximate 
method for computing the statistics
of number of non self-overlapping matches of motifs
in a random text in the non-uniform Bernoulli model.
This method is well suited for protein motifs where the probability of
self-overlap of motifs is small.
For 96% of the <em>Prosite</em> motifs,
the expectations of occurrences of the motifs
 in a 7 million amino-acids  random database
 are computed by the approximate method
with less than 1% error when
compared with the exact method.
 Processing of the whole  <em>Prosite</em> takes
about 30 seconds with the approximate method.
We apply this new method to a comparison of the <em>C. elegans</em> and
<em>S. cerevisiae</em> proteoms.
