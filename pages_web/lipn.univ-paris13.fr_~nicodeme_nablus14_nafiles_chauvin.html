In this mini course, three models are studied: binary search trees (BST), P&oacute;lya urns 
and m-ary search trees (MST). For all of them, a same plan runs along the following outline:
<ol>
<li> A discrete Markovian stochastic process is related to a random tree structure
which comes from analysis of algorithms.
The recursive nature of the problem then gives rise to discrete time martingales.
</li>
<li>
 The process is embedded into continuous time, giving rise to a one
type or a multitype branching process. The associated continuous time martingales 
are connected to the previous discrete time martingales. 
</li>
</ol>
Thanks to the branching property, the asymptotics of this continuous time branching
process is more accessible than in discrete time, where the branching property 
does not hold. 
<br>
In the three cases, BST, P\'olya urns, and MST, the limit of the (rescaled) martingale 
has a non classic distribution. 
We present some expected properties of these limit distribution (density, infinite
divisibility, ...) together with more exciting properties (divergent moment series,
fixed point equation, ...).
