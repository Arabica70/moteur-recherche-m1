 <li>
 The course is a short introduction to Analytic Combinatorics (AC), a
 relatively recent and powerful branch of mathematics that draws upon
 combinatorial and analytic techniques to investigate the properties of
 (large) discrete combinatorial structures. The course will focus on two
 fundamental and representative tools: the symbolic method
 (combinatorial techniques) and singularity analysis (analytical techniques),
 although we will briefly touch upon some other important techniques, 
 methods and tools from AC like the saddle point method. Along the
    course, we will illustrate with numerous examples the basics of AC
    using applications coming from Computer Science, more specifically
    from the analysis of algorithms and data structures.
 Some background on data structures and algorithms (to follow the
    examples and 
 understand the applications of AC), and on elementary probability,
  combinatorics and complex analysis (to understand the principles of
    AC)
  is necessary. First-year undergraduate level must be enough to follow
  the course, but for students who would like to delve into more
    advanced
  material on their own, a stronger background in mathematics and 
 Computer science is
    necessary.
  The fundamental bibliographic reference is the book by Flajolet and
  Sedgewick "Analytic Combinatorics", Cambridge U. Press
 (2009), which is freely available in the web.
