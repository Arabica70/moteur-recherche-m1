Externalized and Internalized Notions of Behavioral Refinement

Many different behavioral refinement notions for algebraic specifications have
been proposed in the literature but the relationship between the various
concepts is still unclear. In this paper we provide a classification and a
comparative study of behavioral refinements according to two directions, the
externalized approach which uses an explicit behavioral abstraction
operator that is applied to the specification to be implemented, and the
internalized approach which uses a built-in behavioral semantics of
specifications. We show that both concepts are equivalent under suitable
conditions. The formal basis of our study is provided by the COL institution
(constructor-based observational logic). Hence, as a side-effect of our study
on internalized behavioral refinements, we introduce also a novel concept of
behavioral refinement for COL-specifications.
