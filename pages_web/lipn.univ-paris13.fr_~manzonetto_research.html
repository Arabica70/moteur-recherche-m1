	     The speculative ambition of replacing the old theory of program approximation based on syntactic continuity with the theory of resource consumption based on Taylor expansion and originating from the differential &lambda;-calculus is nowadays at hand. Using this resource sensitive theory, we provide simple proofs of important results in &lambda;-calculus that are usually demonstrated by exploiting Scott's continuity, Berry's stability or Kahn and Plotkin's sequentiality theory.  
A paradigmatic example is given by the Perpendicular Lines Lemma for the B&ouml;hm tree semantics, which is proved here simply by induction, but relying on the main properties of resource approximants: strong normalization, confluence and linearity.

	     The call-by-value &lambda;-calculus can be endowed with permutation rules, arising from linear logic proof-nets, having the advantage of unblocking some redexes that otherwise get stuck during the reduction. We show that such an extension allows to define a satisfying notion of B&ouml;hm(-like) tree and a theory of program approximation in the call-by-value setting. We prove that all lambda terms having the same B&ouml;hm tree are observationally equivalent, and characterize those B&ouml;hm-like trees arising as actual B&ouml;hm trees of lambda terms. 
We also compare this approach with Ehrhard's theory of program approximation based on the Taylor expansion of lambda terms, translating each lambda term into a possibly infinite set of so-called resource terms. We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for a set of resource terms in order to be the Taylor expansion of a lambda term. Finally, we show that the normal form of the Taylor expansion of a lambda term can be computed by performing a normalized Taylor expansion of its B&ouml;hm tree. From this it follows that two lambda terms have the same B&ouml;hm tree if and only if the normal forms of their Taylor expansions coincide.

	     Despite the fact that call-by-value &lambda;-calculus was defined by Plotkin in 1977, we believe that its theory of program approximation is still at the beginning. A problem that is often encountered when studying its operational semantics is that, during the reduction of a &lambda;-term, some redexes remain stuck (waiting for a value). Recently, Carraro and Guerrieri proposed to endow this calculus with permutation rules, naturally arising in the context of linear logic proof-nets, that succeed in unblocking a certain number of such redexes. In the present paper we introduce a new class of models of call-by-value &lambda;-calculus, arising from non-idempotent intersection type systems. Beside satisfying the usual properties as soundness and adequacy, these models validate the permutation rules mentioned above as well as some reductions obtained by contracting suitable &lambda;I-redexes. Thanks to these (perhaps unexpected) features, we are able to demonstrate that every model living in this class satisfies an Approximation Theorem with respect to a refined notion of syntactic approximant. While this kind of results often require impredicative techniques like reducibility candidates, the quantitative information carried by type derivations in our system allows us to provide a combinatorial proof.

	     The main observational equivalences of the untyped &lambda;-calculus have been characterized in terms of extensional equalities between B&ouml;hm trees.
	     It is well known that the &lambda;-theory H<sup>*</sup>, arising by taking as observables the head normal forms, equates two &lambda;-terms whenever their B&ouml;hm trees are equal up to countably many possibly infinite eta-expansions.
	     Similarly, two &lambda;-terms are equal in Morris's original observational theory H<sup>+</sup>, generated by considering as observable the beta-normal forms, whenever their B&ouml;hm trees are equal up to countably many finite eta-expansions.

	     The &lambda;-calculus also possesses a strong notion of extensionality called "the &omega;-rule", which has been the subject of many investigations.
	     It is a longstanding open problem whether the equivalence B&omega; obtained by closing the theory of B&ouml;hm trees under the &omega;-rule is strictly included in H<sup>+</sup>, as conjectured by Sall&eacute; in the seventies.
In this paper we demonstrate that the two aforementioned theories actually coincide, thus disproving Sall&eacute;'s conjecture.

The proof technique we develop for proving the latter inclusion is general enough to provide as a byproduct a new characterization, based on bounded eta-expansions, of the least extensional equality between B&ouml;hmtrees.
Together, these results provide a taxonomy of the different degrees of extensionality in the theory of B&ouml;hm trees.

	     The &lambda;-calculus enjoys the property that each &lambda;-term has at least one fixed point, which is due to the existence of a fixed point combinator.
		It is unknown whether it enjoys the "fixed point property" stating that each &lambda;-term has either one or infinitely many pairwise distinct fixed points. 
		We show that the fixed point property holds when considering possibly open fixed points. 
		The problem of counting fixed points in the closed setting remains open, but we provide sufficient conditions for a &lambda;-term to have either one or infinitely many fixed points.
		In the main result of this paper we prove that in every sensible &lambda;-theory there exists a &lambda;-term that violates the fixed point property.

		We then study the open problem concerning the existence of a double fixed point combinator and propose a proof technique that could lead towards a negative solution.
		We consider interpretations of the &lambda;Y-calculus into the &lambda;-calculus together with two Reduction Extension Properties, whose validity would entail the non-existence of any double fixed point combinators.
		We conjecture that both properties hold when typed &lambda;Y-terms are interpreted by arbitrary fixed point combinators.
		We prove Reduction Extension Property I for a large class of fixed point combinators.

		Finally, we prove that the &lambda;Y-theory generated by the equation characterizing double fixed point combinators is a conservative extension of the &lambda;-calculus.

	     We study the relational graph models that constitute a natural subclass of relational models of &lambda;-calculus. We prove that among the &lambda;-theories induced by such models there exists a minimal one, and that the corresponding relational graph model is very natural and easy to construct. We then study relational graph models that are fully abstract, in the sense that they capture some observational equivalence between lambda-terms. We focus on the two main observational equivalences in the &lambda;-calculus, the theory H<sup>+</sup> generated by taking as observables the &beta;-normal forms, and H* generated by considering as observables the head normal forms. On the one hand we introduce a notion of &lambda;-K&ouml;nig model and prove that a relational graph model is fully abstract for H<sup>+</sup> if and only if it is extensional and lambda-K&ouml;onig. On the other hand we show that the dual notion of hyperimmune model, together with extensionality, captures the full abstraction for H*.

	     Differential categories were introduced by Blute, Cockett and Seely to axiomatize categorically Ehrhard and Regnier's syntactic
	     differential operator. We present an abstract construction that takes a symmetric monoidal category and yields a differential category,
	     and show how this construction may be applied to categories of games. In one instance, we recover the category previously used to give a
	     fully abstract model of a nondeterministic imperative language. The construction exposes the differential structure already present in
	     this model, and shows how the differential combinator may be encoded in the imperative language. A second instance corresponds to a new
	     differential cartesian category of games. We give a model of a simply-typed resource calculus, Resource PCF, in this category and show
	     that it possesses the finite definability property. Comparison with a semantics based on Bucciarelli, Ehrhard and Manzonetto's relational
	     model reveals that the latter also possesses this property and is fully abstract.

	     We study the semantics of a resource sensitive extension of the lambda calculus in a canonical reflexive object of a category of sets
	     and relations, a relational version of Scott's original model of the pure lambda calculus. This calculus is related to Boudol's
	     resource calculus and is derived from Ehrhard and Regnier's differential extension of Linear Logic and of the lambda calculus.
	     We extend it with new constructions, to be understood as implementing a very simple exception mechanism, and with a "must" parallel
	     composition. These new operations allow to associate a context of this calculus with any point of the model and to prove full
	     abstraction for the finite sub-calculus where ordinary lambda calculus application is not allowed. The result is then extended to the
	     full calculus by means of a Taylor Expansion formula.
	     As an intermediate result we prove that the exception mechanism is not essential in the finite sub-calculus.

	     The differential &lambda;-calculus is a paradigmatic functional programming language endowed with a syntactical differentiation operator
	     that allows to apply a program to an argument in a linear way. One of the main features of this language is that it is resource conscious
	     and gives the programmer suitable primitives to handle explicitly the resources used by a program during its execution. The differential
	     operator also allows to write the full Taylor expansion of a program. Through this expansion every program can be decomposed into an
	     infinite sum (representing non-deterministic choice) of 'simpler' programs that are strictly linear.

	     The aim of this paper is to develop an abstract 'model theory' for the untyped differential &lambda;-calculus. In particular, we
	     investigate what should be a general categorical definition of denotational model for this calculus. Starting from the work of Blute,
	     Cockett and Seely on differential categories we provide the notion of Cartesian closed differential category and we prove that linear
	     reflexive objects living in such categories constitute sound models of the untyped differential &lambda;-calculus.
	     We also give sufficient conditions for Cartesian closed differential categories to model the Taylor expansion. This entails that every
	     model living in such categories equates all programs having the same full Taylor expansion.
	     We then provide a concrete example of a Cartesian closed differential category modeling the Taylor expansion, namely the category MRel of
	     sets and relations from finite multisets to sets. We prove that the relational model <i>D</i> of &lambda;-calculus we have recently built
	     in MRel is linear, and therefore it is also a model of the untyped differential &lambda;-calculus.

	     Finally, we study the relationship between the differential &lambda;-calculus and the resource calculus, a functional programming language
             combining the ideas behind the differential &lambda;-calculus with those behind the lambda-calculus with multiplicities. We define two
             translation maps between these two calculi and we study the properties of these translations. In particular, from this analysis it follows
             that the two calculi share the same notion of model. Therefore the resource calculus can be interpreted by translation into every linear
             reflexive object living in a Cartesian closed differential category.

             Unlike most traditional approaches, our way of interpreting non-determinism does not require any additional powerdomain construction.
             We show that our model provides a straightforward semantics of non-determinism (may convergence) by means of unions of interpretations,
             as well as of parallelism (must convergence) by means of a binary, non-idempotent operation available on the model, which is related to

             More precisely, we introduce a &lambda;-calculus extended with non-deterministic choice and parallel composition, and we define its

	     The aim of this article is twofold. From one side we survey the knowledge we have acquired these last ten years about the lattice of all &lambda;-theories (equational extensions of untyped &lambda;-calculus) and the models of lambda calculus via universal algebra. This includes positive or negative answers to several questions raised in these years as well as several independent results, the state of the art about the long-standing open questions concerning the representability of &lambda;-theories as theories of models, and 26 open problems. On the other side, against the common belief, we show that lambda calculus and combinatory logic satisfy interesting algebraic properties. In fact the Stone representation theorem for Boolean algebras can be generalized to combinatory algebras and &lambda;-abstraction algebras. In every combinatory and &lambda;-abstraction algebra, there is a Boolean algebra of central elements (playing the role of idempotent elements in rings). Central elements are used to represent any combinatory and &lambda;-abstraction algebra as a weak Boolean product of directly indecomposable algebras (i.e. algebras that cannot be decomposed as the Cartesian product of two other non-trivial algebras). Central elements are also used to provide applications of the representation theorem to lambda calculus. We show that the indecomposable semantics (i.e. the semantics of lambda calculus given in terms of models of lambda calculus, which are directly indecomposable as combinatory algebras) includes the continuous, stable and strongly stable semantics, and the term models of all semisensible &lambda;-theories. In one of the main results of the article we show that the indecomposable semantics is equationally incomplete, and this incompleteness is as wide as possible.

It is a longstanding open problem whether the equivalence obtained by closing the theory of B&ouml;hm trees under the &omega;-rule is strictly included in Morris's original observational theory, as conjectured by Sall&eacute; in the seventies.
In a recent work, Breuvart <i>et al.</i> have shown that Morris's theory satisfies the &omega;-rule.
In this paper we demonstrate that the two aforementioned theories actually coincide, thus disproving Sall&eacute;'s conjecture.

	     We study the theory of contextual equivalence in the untyped &lambda;-calculus, generated by taking the normal forms as observables. Introduced by Morris in 1968, this is the original extensional &lambda;-theory H<sup>+</sup> of observational equivalence. On the syntactic side, we show that this &lambda;-theory validates the &omega;-rule, thus settling a long-standing open problem. On the semantic side, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for relational graph models to be fully abstract for H<sup>+</sup>. We show that a relational graph model captures Morris's observational pre-order exactly when it is extensional and &lambda;-K&ouml;nig. Intuitively, a model is &lambda;-K&ouml;nig when every &lambda;-definable tree has an infinite path which is witnessed by some element of the model.

	     Both results follows from a weak separability property enjoyed by terms differing only because of some infinite &eta;-expansion, which is proved through a refined version of the B&ouml;hm-out technique.

	     We propose an algebraization of classical and non-classical logics, based on factor varieties and decomposition operators. In particular, we provide a new method for determining whether a propositional formula is a tautology or a contradiction. This method can be automatized by defining a term rewriting system that enjoys confluence and strong normalization. This also suggests an original notion of logical gate and circuit, where propositional variables becomes logical gates and logical operations are implemented by substitution. Concerning formulas with quantifiers, we present a simple algorithm based on factor varieties for reducing first-order classical logic to equational logic. We achieve a completeness result for first-order classical logic without requiring any additional structure.

	     The category <b>Rel</b> of sets and relations yields one among the simplest denotational semantics of Linear Logic (LL). It is known that <b>Rel</b> is the biproduct completion of the Boolean ring. We consider the generalization of this construction to an arbitrary continuous semiring R, producing a cpo-enriched category which is a semantics of LL, and its (co)Kleisli category is an adequate model of an extension of PCF, parametrized by R. Specific instances of R allow us to compare programs not only with respect to "what they can do", but also "in how many steps" or "in how many different ways" (for non-deterministic PCF) or even "with what probability" (for probabilistic PCF).

	     We study the two Girard's translations of intuitionistic implication into linear logic by exploiting the bang calculus, a paradigmatic
	     functional language with an explicit box-operator that allows both the call-by-name and call-by value &lambda;-calculi to be encoded in.
	     We investigate how the bang calculus subsumes both call-by-name and call-by-value &lambda;-calculi from a syntactic and a semantic viewpoint.

	     We provide a strong normalization result for ML<sup>F</sup>, a type system generalizing ML with first-class polymorphism as in system F.
	     The proof is achieved by translating ML<sup>F</sup> into a calculus of coercions, and showing that this calculus is just a decorated
	     version of system F. Simulation results then entail strong normalization from the same property of system F.
