 <li>
 The talk is about eigenvalues of graph matrices.  We investigate in 
 particular, the adjacency matrix and the distance matrix.  We will
 talk about the properties and some bounds on eigenvalues.  We look at some
 special cases where the eigenvalues are given explicitly.  The
 concentration will be on complete graphs, complete bi-partite graphs,
 cycles, trees and for connected and disconnected graphs. 
  We check eigenvalues for both the adjacency matrix and the distance matrix
 of these graphs. We define coloration and how it may be used to find some 
 eigenvalues, at least the spectral radius of the matrix.
  If time permits, we will talk about graph coloring.  This includes
 the chromatic index, chromatic polynomial, the number of m-colorings 
 and some bounds on the chromatic index.
