<hr> <li><b>Internal coalgebras in varieties</b>
  <b>(with Hans-E. PORST)</b>, <i>Preprint,
26 pages</i>, <a href="Articles/PORST_POINSOT_Internal_coalgebras_RESUBMISSION.pdf">pdf</a>
</li>

<p>The various approaches to internal coalgebras in a cocomplete
category C and in a variety V in particular have been discussed for
example by Kan, Freyd and Bergman. We describe the respective
categories in terms of Lawvere theories T which in particular leads to
the observation that internal T-coalgebras in a cocomplete
category C are nothing but the restriction of left adjoints $Alg T\to
C$ to the dual of T. This result can be seen as a generalization of the
famous Eilenberg-Watts Theorem. We prove that the categories Coalg(T,C)
of internal T-coalgebras in a locally presentable category C are
locally presentable and have a left adjoint forgetful functor into C.
This generalizes and strengthens Bergman's recent completeness result
for categories of internal coalgebras in varieties. Moreover, we show
that Freyd's canonical constructions of internal coalgebras in a
variety are left adjoints. Special instances of the respective right
adjoints are the group-like elements and the primitive elements
functors known from Hopf algebra theory, and in the case where V is a
commutative variety, coreflectors from the category Coalg(T,V) into V.</p>

(co-)algebraic viewpoint</b>, <i>Preprint,
21 pages</i>, <a href="Articles/HilbertAlgebras_18_01_2018_JOT.pdf">pdf</a>
</li>

<p>
The purpose of this contribution is an analysis of semigroup objects in
the category
of Hilbert spaces, hereafter referred to as "Hilbertian algebras",
using Banach (co)algebraic techniques, mainly the Gelfand transform. In
particular,
it is shown that any commutative Hilbertian algebra splits as an
Hilbert direct
sum of a closed subcoalgebra, the closure of the span of the group-like
elements,
and its radical, and that the underlying Banach coalgebra of a
Hilbertian algebra
embeds into a Banach coalgebra of continuous functions on a compact
semigroup.
These results are based on the monoidal functorial relations between
Hilbert spaces,
with the Hilbertian tensor product, and Banach spaces, with either the
injective
or the projective tensor products, and also on the fact that any
Hilbertian algebra
has an adjoint Hilbertian coalgebra which shares the same underlying
Hilbert space.</p>

<hr> <li><b>From combinatorial monoids to bialgebras
and Hopf algebras, functorially</b>, <i>Preprint,
17 pages</i>, <a href="Articles/FDMon_11_03_2014.pdf">pdf</a>
</li>

<p>
This contribution provides a study of some combinatorial monoids,
namely finite decomposition and locally finite monoids, using some
tools from category theory. One corrects the lack of functoriality of
the construction of the large algebras of finite decomposition monoids
by considering the later as monoid objects of the category of sets with
finite-fiber maps. Moreover it is proved that an algebraic monoid
(i.e., a commutative bialgebra) may be associated to any finite
decomposition monoid, and that locally finite monoids furthermore
provide algebraic groups (i.e., commutative Hopf algebras), by
attaching in the first case a monoid scheme to the large algebra, and
in the second case a group scheme to a subgroup of invertible elements
in the large algebra. </p>

<hr> <li><b>Moduli space of pairings on the complex
roots of unity</b> <b>(with Nadia EL MRABET)</b>, <i>Preprint
(presented at AGCT-14, July 2013, Marseille),
20 pages</i>, <a href="Articles/article-09-04-2013.pdf">pdf</a>
</li>

<p>
Beginning with a general concept of bilinear maps and pairings in any
(symmetric) monoidal closed category, we provide a description of the
moduli space of pairings, i.e., a complete solution to the
classification problem of pairings (which is exactly the same as the
classification of finite abelian groups up to isomorphism), up to
isomorphism, from finite abelian groups to the group of complex roots
of unity. We also provide an algebraic description of the monoid of
equivalence classes of pairings as a projective limit of monoids (with
a zero). Moreover we prove a geometric property satisfied by this
monoid, namely that it embeds as a submonoid of the rational points of
an algebraic monoid (on an algebraic closed field). </p>

<hr> <li><b>Elementary group-theoretic approach to
pairings</b> <b>(with Nadia EL MRABET)</b>, <i>Preprint,
13 pages</i>, <a href="Articles/Elem_group_theoretic_pairings4website.pdf">pdf</a>
</li>

<p>
A pair of finite abelian groups is called ``pairing admissible'' if
there exists a non-degenerate bilinear map, called a ``pairing'', from
the product of these groups to a third one. Using some elementary
group-theory, as a main result is proved that two abelian groups are
pairing admissible if, and only if, the canonical bilinear map to their
tensor product is itself a pairing, if and only if, they share the same
exponent. One also observes that being pairing admissible is an
equivalence relation among the class of all finite abelian groups, and
one proves that the corresponding quotient set admits a structure of a
semilattice isomorphic to that of positive integers under divisibility.

<hr> <li><b>Combinatorial classes, generating
functions and a Grothendieck invariant</b>, <i>Preprint,
25 pages</i>, <a href="Articles/FPSandGrothendieckRingV16.pdf">pdf</a>
</li>

<p>
The symbolic method, introduced by P. Flajolet and R. Sedgewick to
compute (ordinary, exponential, and multivariate) generating functions
in a systematic way, makes use of basic objects and some construction
rules -- which, for certain of them, are shown to be functorial in the
present contribution -- to combine them in order to obtain more complex
objects of the same kind (combinatorial classes) so that their
generating functions are computed in a way (actually also functorial)
that reflects these combinations. In this paper, in which we adopt a
functorial point of view, is provided a more general framework to study
these objects, allowing transfinite cardinalities. We prove that the
functional (actually functorial) association of a class to its
generating function is a universal (Grothendieck) invariant. Finally we
also present some constructions of (combinatorial or not) classes that
extend the known ones by application of universal algebra. </p>
