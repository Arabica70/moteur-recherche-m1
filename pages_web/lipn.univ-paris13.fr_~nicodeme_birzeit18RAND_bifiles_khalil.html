 We consider the problem faced by an economic
agent whose trying to find the optimal consumption,investment and
pension strategies while investing his total wealth in a financial
market composed of one risky-free asset and one risky asset whose
prices evolve with time according to linear stochastic differential
equation. We resort to the dynamic programming principle to derive an explicit solution for the problem under consideration
