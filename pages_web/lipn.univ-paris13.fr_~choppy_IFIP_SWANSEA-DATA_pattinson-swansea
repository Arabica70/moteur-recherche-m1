Towards a strategy language for Maude
<BR>------------------------------------------------------
<BR>Narciso Marti-Oliet
(joint work with Jose Meseguer and Alberto Verdejo)

We describe a proposal for a strategy language for Maude, to
control the rewriting process and to be used at the object level instead of
at the metalevel. We also describe a prototype implementation built over
Full Maude using the metalevel and the metalanguage facilities provided
by Maude. We include a series of examples that illustrate the main
features of the proposed strategy language. This language
has been put to work in the implementation of operational semantics
for the ambient calculus and for the parallel functional language Eden.

Domain Theoretic Analysis of Separated Hybrid Automata
<BR>------------------------------------------------------
<BR>talk by Dirk Pattinson, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München 

We define a domain theoretic semantics of non-linear
hybrid automata, and shows that this denotational semantics is effectively
computable. For a hybrid automaton H, the semantics assigns to
every point t in time the set $[| H |](t) of states that H can enter into
at time t, starting from one if its initial states. The semantic function is
defined as a least fixpoint in the domain of compact-set valued
functions of one real variable. This allows to use standard
domain theoretic techniques to obtain effective algorithms to
compute the semantic function, resulting in a directly implementable
framework for the reachability analysis of a large class of
non-linear hybrid automata. As a by-product, we obtain several new
computability and continuity results for hybrid automata.
