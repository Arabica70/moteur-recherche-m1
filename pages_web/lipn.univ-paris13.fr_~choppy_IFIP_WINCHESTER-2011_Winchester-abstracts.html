Non-trivial applications require the distinction of base sorts among all sorts. In the Sig-algebra approach, base components come as subsignatures, while F-co/algebras represent them as the constants functors among the constituents of F. In the case of several sorts taken from a set S, F is an endofunctor on Set^S. We introduce the notion of a signature Sig that captures most of those endofunctors that are practically relevant and have initial and/or final fixpoints. Sig consists of S, a finite set BS of base sets and function symbols f:e->e' where e and e' are type constructions over S and BS. f is interpreted as a natural transformation between the functors from Set^S to Set, which are denoted by e and e', respectively. We show how the elements of initial/final models of Sig can be represented as (equivalence classes of) terms, similarly or dually to the ones associated with traditional many-sorted signatures. <BR><BR><A HREF="http://fldit-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/~peter/DialgSlides.pdf">Here</A> is an unfinished  collection of notions and results on co/algebraic modeling, adapted to the syntax described above.

Theone is a sort of typical combination of abstraction which is proved byinference with proof score and search of limited state space after theabstraction.

Of course, there is already a beautiful andwell-developed theory of categorical logic. Recent efforts connectingcoalgebras and modal logic can also be seen as part of the genericsetting. But more semantic categorical structures are waiting to beexplored. Further, structures coming from model theory and from categorytheory may also be combined.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<LI>6 - <a name="Tarlecki"><B>Andrzej Tarlecki</B></a>, The University of Warsaw, <A HREF="WINCH-DATA/Tarlecki.pdf">slides</A><BR><B>Compositional Property-oriented Semantics for Structured Specifications.Another Old Story (with a Few New Twists)</B><BR>Abstract:<BR>Working in an arbitrary institution, we discuss property-orientedsemantics of specifications built using some collection ofspecification-building operations. As a typical example we considerthe structured specifications built from flat specifications usingunion, translation and hiding. For such specifications we have thestandard compositional proof system, which determines the standardproperty-oriented semantics assigning a theory to each structuredspecification. It is not complete (unless the underlying logic hasinterpolation and enjoys some other technical properties) butotherwise it is "as good as can be expected". In particular, it issound, monotone (and hence compositional) and closed complete. Thelast property means that the semantics (and the corresponding proofsystem) allows us to deduce all true consequences for specificationsbuilt by applying any specification-building operation to argumentspecifications, assuming that there is no discrepancy between theclasses of models of the argument specifications and the classes ofmodels of their respective property-oriented meanings. This is astrong property which was believed to ensure that the semantics is "asstrong as possible" without loosing soundness or compositionality. Wequestion this claim and show that it holds assuming in addition thatthe semantics considered are theory-oriented, i.e., the sets ofproperties assigned to specifications are closed under consequence, aswell as non-absent-minded, i.e., no axioms from flat specificationsare omitted as properties. We sketch examples to show that neither ofthese requirements may be dropped. We generalise this study to thecontext of entailment systems, and show similar results andcounterexamples.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<LI>7 - <a name="Ryan"><B>Mark Ryan</B></a>, University of Birmingham (UK), <A HREF="http://cacm.acm.org/opinion/articles/103200-cloud-computing-privacy-concerns-on-our-doorstep/pdf">paper</A><BR><B>Modelling and verifying privacy properties of web systems</B><BR>[Joint work with] Myrto Arapinis, Sergiu Bursuc (University of Birmingham)<BR>Abstract:<BR>We describe the protocol underlying a novel cloud-based conferencemanagement system that offers strong security and privacy properties.In our system, authors, reviewers and the conference chair interactthrough their web browsers with the cloud, to perform the usual tasksof uploading and downloading papers and reviews.  In contrast withcurrent systems, in our system the cloud provider does not have accessto the content of papers and reviews, and moreover is unable to linkauthors, reviewers, and scores.  We provide a prototype implementation of the system and performance results. We also express the protocol and its desired privacy properties in the language of ProVerif, and automatically prove that the propertieshold.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>== Sunday September 4th, 2011 - 9h --<LI>8 - <a name="Schroeder"><B>Lutz Schr&ouml;der</B></a>, DFKI GmbH, <A HREF="WINCH-DATA/Schroeder.pdf">slides</A><BR><B>Towards the Coalgebraic Guarded Fragment</B><BR>[Joint work with] Daniel Gor&iacute;n <BR>Abstract:<BR>The guarded fragment of first-order logic is in many respects closely related to modal logic in terms of model properties, expressivity, and complexity. We show that the binary guarded fragment is equivalent to a natural extension of the DL ALCHIO which provides additional expressive means for talking about the prestate. We then generalize some of the features relating to the prestate to the coalgebraic setting, and speculate on coalgebraic correspondents for the remaining features.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<LI>1 - <a name="Mossakowsk"><B>Till Mossakowski</B></a>, DFKI GmbH,<A HREF="WINCH-DATA/Mossakowski.pdf">slides</A><BR><B>A structural hybrid logic for CSP and other process algebras</B><BR>[Joint work with] Lutz Schr&ouml;der<BR>Abstract:<BR>Based on Ichiro Hasuo's compositional semantics of GSOS-based process operators, we equip CSP with a compositional transition system semantics. Moreover, we develop a structural hybrid logic for specifying abstract requirements. These requirements can be successively refined to a design, thereby introducing CSP process operators (like parallel composition) - these are all available in the logic, until a pure CSP process is reached. The relation between CSP and the structural hybrid logic is formalised as an institution comorphism that embeds CSP into the logic.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<LI>10 - <a name="Pavlovic"><B>Dusko Pavlovic</B></a>, Royal Holloway / University of London, <A HREF="WINCH-DATA/Pavlovic.pdf">slides</A><BR><B>New directions in security by obscurity</B><BR>Abstract:<BR>Shannon sought security against the attacker with unlimited computational powers: *if an information source conveys some information, then Shannon's attacker will surely extract that information*. In their seminal paper "New directions in cryptography", Diffie and Hellman refined Shannon's attacker model by taking into account the fact that the real attackers are computationally limited. This idea was the stepping stone into modern cryptography.<BR><BR>Shannon also sought security against the attacker with unlimited logical and observational powers, expressed through the maxim that "the enemy knows the system". This view is still fully endorsed in modern cryptography. The popular formulation, going back to Kerckhoffs, is that "there is no security by obscurity", meaning that the algorithms cannot be kept obscured from the attacker, and that security should only rely upon the secret keys. In fact, modern cryptography goes even further than Shannon or Kerckhoffs in tacitly assuming that *if there is an algorithm that can break the system, then the attacker will surely find that algorithm*. The attacker is not viewed as an omnipotent computer any more, but he is still construed as an omnipotent programmer.<BR><BR>Attempting to lift the Diffie-Hellman refinement step from attacker's computational powers, to attacker's programming powers leads to questions of *logical complexity* of specification transformations, such as: Can we formally characterize logical complexity of the task involved of transforming one specification (e.g. of a system and its security requirements) into another specification (e.g. of an attack on that system, breaching the security requirements)?</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<LI>11 - <a name="Schobbens"><B>Pierre-Yves Schobbens</B></a>, FUNDP University of Namur, <A HREF="WINCH-DATA/Schobbens.pdf">slides</A> <!-- partie commente'e--><BR><B>On-the-fly Strategy Synthesis for Event-Clock Linear Temporal Logic on Timed Games!</B><!-- <BR>[Joint work with] --><BR>[Joint work with] Peter Bulychev, Barbara Di Giampaolo, Laurent Doyen,Gilles Geeraerts, Jean-Francois Raskin, Julien Reichert, Tali Sznajder<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>We present a tool for the synthesis of a real-time controller from a timed automatondescribing the plant, and a goal expressed in a real-time linear temporal logic.It extends the UPPAAL-TIGA tool by accepting a richer temporal logic.The problem is EXPTIME-complete; so performance is a critical issue.Our on-the-fly algorithm is based on bounded synthesis.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<LI>12 - <a name="Cirstea"><B>Corina Cirstea</B></a>,University of Southampton, UK, <A HREF="WINCH-DATA/Cirstea.pdf">slides</A>,<A HREF="http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/22229/">paper</A><BR><B>Maximal Traces and Path-Based Coalgebraic Temporal Logics</B><BR>Abstract:<BR>This paper gives a general coalgebraic account of temporal logics whose semantics involves a notion of computation path. Examples of such logics include the logic CTL* for transition systems and the logic PCTL for probabilistic transition systems. Our path-based temporal logics are interpreted over coalgebras of endofunctors obtained as the composition of a computation type (e.g. nondeterministic or stochastic) with a general transition type. The semantics of such logics relies on the existence of execution maps similar to the trace maps introduced by Jacobs and co-authors as part of the coalgebraic theory of finite traces [1]. We consider both finite execution maps derived from the theory of finite traces, and a new notion of maximal execution map that accounts for maximal, possibly infinite executions. The latter is needed to recover the logics CTL* and PCTL as specific path-based logics.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<!-- partie commente'e-->
