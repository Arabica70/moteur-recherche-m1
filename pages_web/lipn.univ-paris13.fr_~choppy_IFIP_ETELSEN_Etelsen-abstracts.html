In this talk, it is suggested that SOS might benefit considerably from adoption of the much richer signatures provided by the Common Algebraic Specification Language (CASL), as well as from the use of CASL's structured specifications to express the relationship between the various parts of SOS specifications. However, specifying SOS rules as Horn clauses in CASL has some potential drawbacks, such as the need to consider the full CASL logic when reasoning about the ways in which transitions can be derived, and whether CASL's free models provide adequate foundations for SOS in the presence of negative premises of rules.Note that CASL already has an extension, CASL-LTL, which is intended for general use in specifying labelled transition systems and reactive systems. CASL-LTL involves dynamic sorts, and allows temporal logic formulae. SOS specifications of programming languages and process algebras do not appear to require the direct use of temporal logic.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<LI>2 - <a name="Klin"><B>Bartek Klin</B></a>,University of Cambridge and University of Warsaw<!-- partie commente'e<A HREF="Etelsen-abstracts.html#Klin">ABSTRACT</A>,Combining distributive laws towards SOS modularity--><BR><B>SOS, modal logic and compositionality</B><A HREF="ETELSEN-DATA/Klin.pdf">slides</A><BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>A flexible technique of proving compositionality of behavioural equivalenceson SOS-defined languages is introduced.

Perhaps the only  notable exception widely noticed by the community is the  care needed in the treatment of many-sorted equational logic.  However, while the standard results remain valid in essence  in the many-sorted frameworks, some nuances and technicalities  require considerably more care in formulation and proof of the  results. We give some examples of such situation, indicating  how equational calculus, Birkhoff's variety theorem and  interpolation results should be adjusted for many-sorted algebras.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<LI>5 - <a name="BKB"><B>Bernd Krieg-Brueckner</B></a>, DFKI Bremen and Universitaet Bremen<A HREF="ETELSEN-DATA/BKBs-pushout.pdf">slides</A> <!-- partie commente'e<A HREF="Etelsen-abstracts.html#BKB">ABSTRACT</A>,--><BR><B>Safe and secure cognitive systems or BKB's pushout</B><BR><I>Joint work with:</I> Lutz, Till Mossakowski, Christoph Lueth, Dieter Hutter, Udo Freser, Thomas Roefer,Hui Shi et al.<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>Over the past ten years, research in the development of safe and secure cognitive systems at Universitaet Bremen and DFKI Bremen has alternated between the development of the underlying formal methods and tools, and applying them in particular applications domains. The application domain of cognitive systems is sketched and illustrated. Human-machine interaction (in particular natural language dialogue) with mobility assistants for navigation and with the intelligent environ¬ment in Ambient Assisted Living require the definition of semantics with structured ontologies and reasoning with qualitative spatial calculi. Moreover, we observe a (self) similarity of research issues at various levels in a hierarchy of smart components and systems, from the incorporation of increasingly more intelligent sensorial materials in smart products to large logistic systems with human interaction: complex processes and autonomous decisions in a society of autonomous agents, with a need for coordination and negotiation of common (environmental) conditions, monitoring the status, with a need for a reconfiguration of service and control processes once an anomalous situation has been detected. This requires further basic research on heterogeneous semantic integration of processes.<BR><I>Links to <A HREF="http://www.dfki.de/sks">DFKI-SSKS</A>and <A HREF="http://www.baall.net">BAALL</A></I></LI> <BR>------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>== Monday, July 5th - 9h -- / 15h --<LI>6 - <a name="Baldan"><B>Paolo Baldan</B></a>,University of Padova <A HREF="ETELSEN-DATA/Baldan.pdf">slides</A><!-- partie commente'e--><BR><B>A logic for true concurrency</B><BR><I>Joint work with:</I> Silvia Crafa <!-- <BR>[Joint work with] --><BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>We propose a logic for true concurrency whose formulae predicate aboutevents in computations and their causal dependencies. <BR>The inducedlogical equivalence is hereditary history preserving bisimilarity, andfragments of the logic can be identified which <BR>correspond to othertrue concurrent behavioural equivalences in the literature: step,pomset and history preserving bisimilarity. <BR>Standard Hennessy-Milnerlogic, thus (interleaving) bisimilarity, is also recovered as afragment. <BR>We believe that this contributes to a rational presentationof the true concurrent spectrum and <BR>to a deeper understanding of therelations between the involved behavioural equivalences.<BR><I>Link to <A HREF="http://www.math.unipd.it/~baldan/Papers/Soft-copy-pdf/ConcLogic.pdf">paper</A></I></LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<LI>7 - <a name="Maibaum"><B>Tom Maibaum</B></a>, McMaster University<!-- partie commente'e<A HREF="Etelsen-abstracts.html#Maibaum">ABSTRACT</A>,Locality and bisimulation--><BR><B>Characterizing encapsulation with bisimulation</B><A HREF="ETELSEN-DATA/Maibaum.pdf">slides</A> <BR><I>Joint work with:</I> Pablo Castro, Universidad Nacional de Rio Cuarto, Argentina<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR></LI>In this paper we investigate formal mechanisms to allow designersto decompose specifications (stated in a given logic) into severalcomponents. The basic ideas come from [1] where some notions fromcategory theory are used to put together logical specifications. In thissetting the concept of locality allows designers to write separate specificationsand then compose them. However, as the work of Fiadeiro andMaibaum [1] is stated in a linear temporal logic, we investigate how toextend these notions to a branching time logic, which can be used tospecify systems where non-determinism is a relevant mechanism. Sincewe are interested in specifying and verifying fault-tolerant systems; wealso introduce deontic operators in our logic, we have shown in [2] thatdeontic logic allow us to express notions such as ideal and abnormalbehavior which are closely related to fault-tolerance.<BR><BR>1.

The verification of properties of such systems is a difficult task due to many aspects: the systems in many situations involve an infinite number of states; states themselves are complex and large; there are a number of different computation possibilities due to the fact that rule applications may occur in parallel. There are already some approaches to verification of graph grammars based on model checking, but in these cases only finite state systems can be analyzed. Other approaches propose over- and/or under-approximations of the state-space, but in this case it is not possible to check arbitrary properties. In this work, we propose to use the Event-B formal method and its theorem proving tools to analyze graph grammars. We show that a graph grammar can be translated into an Event-B specification preserving its semantics, such that one can use several theorem provers available for Event-B to analyze the reachable states of the original graph grammar. The translation is based on a relational definition of graph grammars, that was shown to be equivalent to the Single- Pushout approach to graph grammars.</LI> <BR>------------------------------------------------------<LI>9 - <a name="Chemouil"><B>David Chemouil</B></a>, Onera<!-- partie commente'e<A HREF="Etelsen-abstracts.html#Chemouil">ABSTRACT</A>--><BR><B>Some challenges for formal methods -Lessons learnt in the European aerospace industry</B><A HREF="ETELSEN-DATA/Chemouil.pdf">slides</A><BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>In this presentation, I will give a personal account on systems andsoftware engineering in the European aerospace industry.

The most expressive logics ofthis type are the mu-calculus and its relatives. However, popular  fixedpoint logics tend to trade expressivity for simplicity and  readability,and in fact often live within the single variable  fragment of themu-calculus. The family of such flat fixed point logics includes, e.g.,CTL, the *-nesting-free fragment of PDL, and the logic of commonknowledge. Here, we extend this notion to the generic semantic frameworkof coalgebraic logic, thus covering a wide range of logics beyond thestandard mu-calculus including, e.g., flat fragments of the gradedmu-calculus and the alternating-time mu-calculus (such as ATL), as wellas probabilistic and monotone fixed point logics. Our main results arecompleteness of the Kozen-Park axiomatization and a timed-out tableauxmethod that matches \EXP upper bounds inherited from the coalgebraicmu-calculus but avoids using automata.<BR><I>Link to <A HREF="http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~lschrode/papers/flatfix.pdf">paper</A></I></LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>== Tuesday, July 6th - 9h<LI>12 - <a name="Koenig"><B>Barbara Koenig</B></a>, University of Duisburg-Essen<!-- partie commente'e<A HREF="Etelsen-abstracts.html#Koenig">ABSTRACT</A>,--><BR><B>A Logic on Subobjects and Recognizability</B><A HREF="ETELSEN-DATA/Koenig.pdf">slides</A> <BR><I>Joint work with:</I> Sander Bruggink<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR> We first give an introduction to monadic second-order logic, recognizable graph languages and graph decompositions.

Despite their widespread adoption as a theoretical tool, they still face some unresolved semantical issues, since the standard operational and denotational methods often proved inadequate to reason about these formalisms. A domain which has been successfully employed for languages with asymmetric communication, like the  pi-calculus, are presheaf categories based on (injective) relabelings. Calculi with symmetric binding, in the spirit of the fusion calculus, give rise to novel research challenges. The talk discusses the calculus of explicit fusions, and propose to model its syntax and semantics by a presheaf category, indexed over equivalence relations.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------<LI>15 - <a name="Gnesi"><B>Stefania Gnesi</B></a>, Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione "A.

The temporal logic MHML is based on the classical Hennessy--Milner logic with Until and we interpret it over Modal Transition Systems (MTSs). MTSs extend the classical notion of Labelled Transition Systems by distinguishing possible (<I>may</I>) and required (<I>must</I>) transitions: these two types of transitions are useful to describe variability in behavioural descriptions of product families. This leads to a novel <I>deontic</I> interpretation of the classical modal and temporal operators, which allows the expression of both constraints over the products of a family and constraints over their behaviour in a single logical framework. Finally, we sketch model-checking algorithms to verify MHML formulae as well as a way to derive correct products from a product family description.<BR><BR>to appear on the proceedings of   IFM 2010 LNCS.Springer<BR><BR>related papers:<BR>- P.
