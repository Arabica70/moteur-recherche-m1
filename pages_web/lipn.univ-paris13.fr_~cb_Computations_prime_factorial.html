<H4>On the distance between the prime factorial and the
previous/next prime number</H4>


The <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem">distribution of prime numbers</a> 
is one of the most fundamental problems in mathematics. It is nicely related to complex analysis,
as e.g. explained in the following lecture note on <A HREF="http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~banderier/Seminar/vardi3.html">analytic number theory</a>.
<P>
Let us define the "prime factorial of order <em>n</em>"
as the product of the first <em>n</em> prime numbers:
<em>f<sub>n</sub>=p<sub>1</sub> &times; p<sub>2</sub> &times;
  ... &times; p<sub>n</sub></em>.<BR>
E.g. <em>f<sub>5</sub>= 2 &times; 3 &times; 5 &times; 7 &times; 11=
  2310, f<sub>6</sub>= 2 &times; 3 &times; 5 &times; 7 &times; 11
  &times; 13=30030.</em>

(These numbers f<sub>n</sub> are also sometimes called "primorial").<BR>
<P>
When I was a child, I was astonished to read in the <em>Dictionnaire des math&eacute;matiques</Em> (by Le Lionnais/Bouvier/Georges)
that a so-called "conjecture de Fortune" claims that f<sub>n</sub>+1 is always a prime number.
Well, I quickly checked and, in fact 
 f<sub>1</sub>+1=3,
 f<sub>2</sub>+1=7,
 f<sub>3</sub>+1=31,
 f<sub>4</sub>+1=211,
 f<sub>5</sub>+1 =2311, are all primes... but  f<sub>6</sub>+1 = 59 &times; 509 is certainly not !

<BR>
Therefore, something was wrong in the way this books presented the conjecture. I will give later the correct conjecture.




<BR>
Some interesting values of <em>n</em> are those for which
<em>f<sub>n</sub>-</em>1 or <em>f<sub>n</sub>+</em>1 is prime.
These sequences are in fact a way to prove that there exist infinitely many prime numbers  as done by Euclid in his nice "reductio ad absurdum".
<P>

A natural conjecture (we will explain why hereafter) is the following one
<! that I never saw in the literature before in all its generality: !>
<P>
<B>The Prime Factorial Conjecture:</B>
<LI>The distance <em>d<sub>n</sub><SUP><SMALL>+</SMALL></SUP></EM>
between the prime factorial <em>f<sub>n</sub></em>
and the first prime greater
 than <em>f<sub>n</sub></em> is either 1, either a prime number.<BR>
<LI>Similarly, the distance
<em>d<sub>n</sub><SUP><SMALL>-</SMALL></SUP></EM>
between the prime factorial
<em>f<sub>n</sub></em>
and the first prime least
 than <em>f<sub>n</sub></em>  is either 1, either a prime number. 
<P>


The second line is Banderier's conjecture while the 
first line is known as Fortune's conjecture 
(which leads to the so-called "fortunate numbers"). 
Fortune's conjecture (the first prime greater than a given prime 
factorial) is studied in the section A2 
of the famous book of Richard K. Guy "Unsolved Problems in Number Theory"
(2nd edition, Springer, 1994).

<B>Who was R.F. Fortune ?</B><BR>
Reo Franklin Fortune (1903-1979) was a social
anthropologist, lecturer in social anthropology at the Cambridge
University, specialist in Melanesian language and culture
(confer the obituaries "Reo FORTUNE (1903-1979)", by Michael W. Young in "Canberra
Anthropology"  vol. 3, n.1, pp 105-108, 1980).
R.F. Fortune joined in 1941 the <A HREF="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/anthropology/history.htm">Department of Anthropology at University of Toronto</a>.
 Fortune was married to <A href="http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/margaretmead.html">Margaret Mead</a> from 1928 to 1935
(<A HREf="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead">Margaret Mead</a> did have three husbands...the first was Luther Cressman 
from 1923-28. I believe he was a minister. The second was Reo Fortune, a 
New Zealand psychologist turned anthropologist from 1928-35. The third 
was Gregory Bateson (1936-50). He was a British anthropologist whose 
strong natural science background influenced Mead's work.
<SMALL>[Information from a book called Women Anthropologists - Selected 
Biographies edited by Gacs, Khan, McIntyre, and Weinberg. USA: Greenwood 
press, 1988]</SMALL>). 
Fortune is well known for his <A HREf="http://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=reo+fortune">ethnographies</a> of the Dobu and Manus islanders 
of the Pacific. What many anthropologists do not realize is that
he is also known to mathematicians for his conjecture on prime
 numbers, or "Fortunate Numbers"! Levin et al. (1984), 
report a story that Fortune once attempted to conclude an
academic dispute with McIlwraith by challenging him to a duel with any weapon of his
choice from the collections of the Royal Ontario Museum.
Here are <A HREF="warms.txt">other anecdotes</a> kindly communicated to me 
by Richard L. Warms.
<P>
The reader amazed by this "link" between anthropology and  mathematics
should keep in mind that is not the only one:
remember Claude Lévi-Strauss, whose mathematical 
considerations influenced his science and the structuralist
school (I consider that this is perhaps in linguistic that
structuralism was the most fruitful, with applications in computer
sciences to programming languages). Note that the (ab)use of mathematics by Lacan and other people in
human sciences was at the origin of the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_Affair">Sokal affair</a>.
<P>

I am not aware of literature about the case of the first prime less than a given prime factorial, so I
suggest to call "unfortunate numbers" the
<em>d<sub>n</sub><SUP><SMALL>-</SMALL></SUP></EM>'s
(whereas the 
<em>d<sub>n</sub><SUP><SMALL>+</SMALL></SUP></EM>'s
are already known as fortunate numbers, as probably coined by M. Gardner,
see e.g. The Last Recreations).


<P><B>Heuristics:</B>
If <em>d<sub>n</sub><SUP><SMALL>+</SMALL></SUP></EM>
were not prime, then 
<em>d<sub>n</sub><SUP><SMALL>+</SMALL></SUP>=(p<sub>n+1</sub>)<SUP>2</SUP></EM>
or a greater composite number.
Asymptocally, one has
log( <EM>f<SUB>n</SUB></eM>
)=O(<EM>p<SUB>n</SUB></EM>/log( <EM>p<SUB>n</SUB></EM> ))
and Shinzel's conjecture (there is always a prime between x and
x+ln(x)<SUP>2</SUP>) thus implies that the <EM>d<SUB>n</SUB></EM>'s are primes.

<P><B>Computations:</B>
I give below the list of fortune and unfortunate numbers

(EIS refers to the Encyclopedia of integer sequences).
Caveat: thus the 2 conjectures are checked for <em>n<1300</em>, provided 
Algorithm P. (in D.E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Vol 2,
2nd edition, Section 4.5.4) does not fail when answering that a given
number is indeed prime [this is not yet proven for numbers of ten
thousands digits]. This is the algorithm used by Maple, it would be
interesting to cross-check my results with other computer algebra
software (Mathematica, Pari, ...) relying on other primality
tests. However, all of them are probabilistic tests (Mathematica uses
multiple Rabin-Miller and Lucas, Pari GP uses Baillie-Pomerance-Selfridge-Wagstaff 
and Lucas) and the best known deterministic test is about 1000 times slower.

[Addendum Oct. 2006:] since the creation of this page, many websites mention the
fortunate primes, let me give here some of them :

T.D. Noe checked the computations in Mathematica 
for fortunate primes until n=2000, and unfortunate primes until n=1000 and communicated me few typos in
my list (see his results on the EIS website).
