<BR><p>The first edition of the conference "Discrete
	Random Walks" will hold in Paris 1-5 September 2003. 
<P>



   Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original research 
on theoretical aspects or applications of Discrete Random Walks. 
Surveys are also warmly welcomed. Typical areas include 
(but are not limited to):

<UL>
<LI>  Combinatorics: enumeration & asymptotics of lattice paths,
     non-crossing paths and Young tableaux, polyominos & animals,
     statistics on permutations, loop-erased random walks, 
     bijective approach, continued fractions and orthogonal polynomials...
<LI>  Computer science: analysis of algorithms, automata and attribute grammars,
    random generation of combinatorial structures, approximate counting, 
    random walks on convex sets, applications of MCMC algorithms...
    simulated annealing and local search, lattices in temporal logic...
<LI>  Probability theory: queueing theory, limit laws for walk parameters, 
     Brownian motion (transformation, identities), econometrics,
     analysis of Markov chains...
<LI>  Biology: genetic distance & pattern matching, genetic algorithms,
     PCR analysis, population dynamics...
<LI>  Statistical Physics: analysis of Glauber dynamics, connections with
     phase transitions, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods,
     self avoiding walks, determinant evaluation, 
     eigenvalues of random matrices, solvable models... 
</UL>



 <P>
   Authors are invited to submit a draft of a full paper with at most
12 pages. The paper should contain a succinct statement of the issues 
and of their motivation, a summary of the main results, and a brief
explanation of their significance, accessible to non-specialist readers. 
Authors are encouraged to give (at least in their introduction) 
a discrete mathematics motivation for their work 
(analytical and algebraic methods are then welcome) explaining what 
their work brings to the knowledge of discrete random walks 
in a lattice or a graph, or to an equivalent model. 

Submissions must be made via the
<A HREF="http://dmtcs.loria.fr/compose/index.html">DMTCS Submission Server</a>.

(Select "new" and "Conference volume: Discrete Random walks").

[<SMALL>If you meet any problem with this process (e.g. after one day,
you didn't receive any email saying that your submission is ok)
you can send your .ps file to random@<em></em>blagny.inria.fr</SMALL>]

<P>
Authors are
expected to present their accepted papers at the conference.
<P>
      Submissions were due for May 9, 2003.  <P>Questions can be sent to
	<A HREF="http://algo.inria.fr/banderier/">Cyril.Banderier</a><em> at </em>inria.fr <BR>
	Notification will be sent July 5, 2003 (formerly June, 25  2003) and final versions are due
for July 25, 2003.
